4,little-sheep-mongolian-hot-pot-san-gabriel,"came in starving and left fuller than expected so that must mean it was a worthwhile trip right ?haha in all seriousness , little sheep has been on my to try list for a while since i love mongolian style hot pot but have yet to find any new ones after my family 's go to spot closed down .this place was clean and the service was prompt !they are located on the second floor of the plaza .luckily , we came when it was practically empty around noon on a sunday so we were seated immediately .the menu has a huge range of options to order from for $ 23/person ayce which makes me plenty happy .you get three rounds for ordering and can order as much as you want each round !everything tasted delicious and came out quickly too -- we got the house original herbal broth since the spicy broth is supposedly killer spicy .they have a sauce bar with not too many sauces other than the essentials including sesame sauce , satay , and sweet soy sauce .parking is terrible in this plaza , of course , but you might have more luck at the lowest level in the underground parking structure !the only real thing that took off one star for me was that the meat quality noticeably decreased each round , nothing uncommon but still disappointing .overall will come back since it definitely satisfies the hot pot cravings !",YkN5jUU6KYENBhCIlZpsSw,Los Angeles,m5fQIgPjSVAYf6a2n7BpDw,L9Ra0jmM1EgctN5ry29XEQ
2,lolas-peruvian-restaurant-glendale,"end of the world my ass .had the world ended as the mayans predicted , this meal would have been my last .thank quetzacotal it was not because lola 's was not impressive and i apologize for referencing the mayans and not the incans since lola 's is peruvian food .whatever .lola 's is a sit-down restaurant that looks ghetto from the outside , but feels like a steakhouse for old white people on the inside despite the photos of avocados and machu picchu because it is dimly lit .i mean is it just me or are all the old-fashioned steakhouses really fucking dark ?anyhow , lola 's tries to be a fancy restaurant more akin to el pollo inka than mario 's .however , unlike the aforementioned peruvian restaurants , they charge nearly twice as much for less food that simply does not taste as good .when a server notices you walk in from brand boulevard and you are finally seated , lola 's provides complimentary bread and two dipping sauces .one was an aji sauce ( green ) and one was a mayo-chili sauce ( yellowish green ) .the aji sauce had a slight kick and the mayo-chili sauce was interesting and reminded me of wasabi .i just wish that lola 's could have provided bigger portions for the sauces because unlike other peruvian restaurants where they have the sauce on the side of the table , lola 's brings tiny dipping containers where the sauces are refilled too few and far between .as for the main course , the wife and i ordered one lomo saltado and one saltado de mariscos .lomo saltado is the most well-known dish of peru and it 's literally a fusion of indigenous peruvian cuisine married with asian flavors .it consists of strips of sirloin stir-fried in a marinade of soy sauce and other spices with potato wedges , tomatoes and red onions that is served with white rice .saltado de mariscos is basically the same thing as lomo saltado except the beef is replaced with a seafood medley of shrimp , mussels , and squid .taste-wise the flavors were okay , but i felt both dishes were on the salty side .perhaps lola 's needs to capitalize salt in saltado .constant water refills as well as inca kola were needed .service-wise they definitely needed more than two servers for a friday dinner service .trying to get refills and attempting to pay are two of my many pet peeves .but the latter is what i hate the most .i mean i just fucking hate restaurants where you ca n't leave !is it so hard to give me the bill and bring back my credit card within 5 minutes ?especially when the world is ending ?so to recount , one small-portioned lomo saltado dish , one small-portioned saltado de mariscos dish , and one inca kola came out to over $ 40 .all i know is , if the world is going to end again , i wo n't be coming back to lola 's when there are better tasting and cheaper options out there .pictures : mini dipping sauces yelp.com/biz_photos/lola… our meal yelp.com/biz_photos/lola… -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - parking is metered parking along brand boulevard or a metered parking lot located east of the restaurant at the intersection of california and maryland .",j1981ubRRPjeRTx9UkMJ5g,Los Angeles,h860J4W-OiYVZsChQCd0uA,lZxDHP3OBIf3x2bnzR2v4A

1,original-roadhouse-grill-long-beach,"after years of bypassing this place i finally stopped in for lunch .the food is okay and the service is friendly but not attentive ; make sure you carefully check your bill as they are prone to errors in their rush ( more on that later ) .this is one of those places where , once you are seated , they bring you a small bucket of peanuts to munch on and you throw the shells on the floor .you would rightly assess that this is also the sort of place that brings you large portions of food .i ordered the pulled pork sandwich .it came with a choice of one side and there were about 10 to choose from ; i picked a house salad .a delicious warm biscuit was brought out with some honey butter followed by my salad .the salad was standard - a solid typical american salad - nothing out of the ordinary but good .the pulled pork sandwich came out relatively quickly , even before i 'd finished the salad .the bun was huge and was simply too much bread .about halfway through the sandwich i removed the top and ate it open-faced .the pork was slathered in a delicious bbq sauce - slightly sweet with a bit of tanginess and a tiny bit of heat .unfortunately that was all i could taste - i searched for the smokey pork flavor but could n't find it .the texture of the pulled pork was kinda mushy which i did n't care for .i got occasional hints of flavor from the coleslaw on the sandwich but again the bbq sauce pretty much overpowered it .at least the coleslaw provided some textural crunch .service was acceptable up until this point considering they were obviously understaffed .when my credit card was brought back with the bill , the amount was well over double the actual cost .it took me 15 minutes to get my server 's attention to supposedly rectify the situation which was rather frustrating .she assured me the wrong charges had been reversed and the correct charge processed .but when i got home i checked and the incorrect charges were applied to my account and no correction was made.ugh , what a nightmare .several days after contacting my credit card company and the manager of the restaurant the correct charge was processed .wish i had kept bypassing this place and will continue to bypass them in the future .",0CKo5RHHoN6AI7vSMnKV_g,Los Angeles,pvocmRFgimDr99m23j7efw,fa94aibNHjDgCnafEAsNHg

''i got the sense that he really cared about my order .the food : i ordered combo # 12 ( two burritos , rice , and beans ) - burrito # 1 - lengua ( tongue ) - very tender meat , well flavored , and the chef boyardi-like sauce that smothered the two burritos added a nice little `` kick . ''burrito # 2 - carnitas ( dried pork ) - at least it seemed like it .it was damn dry and borderline crunchy .i felt like i almost broke a tooth biting into it .this was a failed burrito , sadly .even chef boyardi could n't save it .the refried beans were okay .and the rice was n't nothing spectacular .chimichanga - definitely better than your average costco chimichangas , but nothing to waste postage on ( write home about ! , hehe ) .the plentiful supply of guac and sour cream definitely helped things out a bit though .horchata - embarrassing .they poured it out of this authentic looking vat .a very convincing touch to make you feel like you 're gettin ' some seriously home-made horchata !well .if you like kern 's safeway horchata , then you 'll love this stuff .in other words , it was terrible !the food also took quite awhile to arrive .something like , 10-15 mins .i was kinda surprised considering how few people there were in the restaurant .i liked the overall feel of the joint , but the taste experience could 've been better .if not for the super nice staff , i 'd probably drop it another star .",pdq8mplROSDvKyMtRxUHag,San Francisco,twEstQyCC8QDlKZSAyoqLg,6CcNZ7jXqJ60iFu6LNopQg

''i would have been ok. as i began to write this review , i noticed that i had this dish or something very similar last year and i described the jumbo prawns as `` meaty '' and no mention of their size being less than jumbo .as i was leaving the restaurant , i saw a wall of pictures of their dishes .and what do i see ?chu chee jumbo prawns with actual jumbo-sized prawns !some may call this `` false advertisement '' , `` lying '' , or even `` stealing '' .",FJ2OcvIz49mwWYkVCkouIg,San Francisco,-0zvOjiy97hH142aOd9tTg,iihnCZrJBxs5TRcpVBloFA
2,brodard-restaurant-garden-grove,"- locale destination - i did n't know there was a seating area on the other side of main dining area .they mainly offer drinks and desserts there , but they do use the tables when the main room was full .cleaness : well , i 'm asian , yet i should say `` japanese '' in this case .japanese are very picky when it comes to `` hygene '' .they are almost `` neat freak '' .in japan , you see so many products are `` germ-free '' coated .i do n't know what they do , but they 're supposed to be better than non `` germ-free '' ones i guess ; p we 're probably the only people that recycle in true way - they have 5 or 6 categories for recycle and they wash them all very clean unlike here .most of them do carry recycle bags surprisingly .that being said , i do n't mind hole in the wall and pop & mom places .but i do prefer and expect `` cleaness '' since i do n't wan na get a food poisoning .over 50 million people ( every year ) get food poisoning just because of `` restaurant workers not washing hands properly '' .but there 's little way i could check the kitchen inside or how the staff keep themselves and the foods clean and safe .but this place , i doubt that they have a high standard on `` hygene '' and `` cleaness '' .my section was a total mess - table was n't wiped , dirty dishes were piled up on the table , the floor was mess .there was a picture of bug on lettuce on their yelp page , and my buddy saw a big cockroach here long time ago .now i feel like i should avoid here despite of the decent spring rolls .- gluttony expedition - spicy beef salad : the beef was tender , big portion , pouring a little sour dressing ( kinda like the one for vermicelli ) .it was n't spicy at all .not bad , yet not that exciting as many yelpers claimed .pad thai : they put good amount of shrimps and chickens , but very bland .lavender milk tea with boba : it did n't taste like lavender at all .it was almost like some sort of `` chocolate '' drink .terrible .boba was n't so fully tender , either .i 'll avoid drinks here .worse than `` class 302 '' ( amazing shaved snow , but their drinks are pretty meh ) in irvine .spring rolls : i did like them before , but this time i did n't feel `` fresh '' .they were dry - they seemed like sitting in the kitchen for a while .also i did like the dipping sauce .this time , it was kinda bland .i know they 're busy all the time , yet they seem to start cutting corner on food and the cleaness .disappointing .- conqueror 's deduction - i go to vietnamese places quite often as you know .yeah , many people including asian people would agree with me that many asian places like `` chinese '' and `` vietnamese '' have lower standards on hygiene in general than japanese .but this place is below the average on cleaness standard .the place is n't so clean .on top of that , the foods become a half ass .just because you 're packed for some reasons , it does n't mean you can be whatever .i can eat yummier vietnamese food at somewhere else ( cleaner ) in the little saigon .i 'm done here .",RQT9QoVcQd9gnKhayD5cUw,Los Angeles,GBQ6vkJ2YAMOof_9GekS2g,m1K-79PP1DR4sm3m7SG-ew

''-- well no , it was a small portion in comparison to my usual places -- and was n't worth $ 19 imo .and they do have the boldness to add an 17.7 % service charge onto your bill -- which was unexpected for a take-out-decor place that i was looking forward to leaving .i mentioned that the charge was n't noted on the menu and he could care less .he looked at me like i should n't even ask about it .i never heard of one person paying a service charge .and i can still taste the msg which i asked them not to use .never going back",ESRB3FYjruJQRBMfK665nQ,New York,7cDSyhVF1TIkAJzh_1sNLg,ELTCnjdEVdDghibIrLJ9Lw

4,amali-new-york-3,"i already know i 'm going to run out of characters .do n't say i did n't warn you .we did extensive research on prix fixe menus before finally landing on amali for valentine 's day .we want options .prix fixe means fewer options .that does n't sit well with me .but on valentine 's day , it 's quite difficult to find a nice restaurant - at least in new york - that is offering something other than prix fixe .so when we noticed that amali , a sustainable mediterranean restaurant that had been on my list for some time , was giving us substantially more options than most mediterranean spots in the city , it was settled .in short , this is not a review of the full menu - but we still covered a lot of ground .the vibe at amali is n't at all cohesive .it 's slightly rustic , slightly industrial , quite intimate , sophisticated in certain ways and banal in others .it 's more upscale that your average restaurant , but not in any sort of pretentious/snotty way .thankfully , that lack of cohesion is not at all reflected in the menu .all options - prix fixe and beyond - make sense .clean , mediterranean flavors with an emphasis on seafood , punctuated with some standout cheeses .while most dishes were big hits , there were a couple that missed the mark in subtle ways .so while i 'd love to give amali 4.5 stars - if yelp allowed such a thing - i 'm rounding down to four .a short tangent first .while waiting for our food , we noticed - and do n't tell me you have n't done the same thing - that the couple next to us was enjoying a burrata dish that looked nothing short of a masterpiece .much to my parents ' chagrin , i never really learned how to use my `` inside voice '' .so of course when my equally eager company and i realized what was so close yet so far , we had to take note .apparently , we were not in the least bit subtle about this .the couple , perhaps floating on their appropriately-colored pink cloud due to a romantic dinner on valentine 's day , gracious offered us this plate .they insisted that they were done .we 'd be fools not to accept !so we did .and man , this was debatably the best thing we consumed all night .fluffy perfection - i truly believe that 's what the clouds in heaven , if such a place exists , are made of ( some dairy-free for my lactose intolerant friends , of course ) , now for our order : feta dip : a .ai n't much to say here .hard to screw up feta dip - this was no exception .my only wish : more pita chips !we got maybe six small chips for that whole bowl of wonder and running out of them quickly detracted from the overall enjoyment .but still a very yummy starter .octopus a la plancha : b+ the disappointment of the night .there was nothing ostensibly wrong with the octopus , but it fell short for me .the preparation was just okay , the flavors were more muted than i typically like , and the preparation , for lack of a better word , was boring .i 'm kind of an octopus slut - i ca n't help myself - so i 've been around .this is far from the best i 've had .i was n't bad , but considering the venue , i expected more .scallops w/ black-eyed peas : a- i adore shellfish .scallops have never been my favorite - that award has definitively been given to mussels .but i was pleasantly surprised with how much i liked this preparation .the scallops were cooked perfectly , and the black-eyed peas were a nice , muted counterpart .it did n't wow me in any particular way , but it was really good nonetheless .lobster pasta : a-/a creamy , dreamy pasta starring the fanciest of crustaceans .my indecision around the rating is due to the lack of actual lobster in the dish .it 's not a large serving of pasta to begin with , but if we 're paying for lobster , i expect there to be a more gracious ratio .that said , what we did get was delicious .do n't think it 's offered on amali 's normal menu , but it 's still worth keeping in mind in the case of specials .mussels : a- as you may have guessed , i 'm a snob when it comes to my mussels .so to receive an a from me is saying a lot .these were prepared in a white wine sauce and seasoned very nicely .i ca n't give them an a , but i 'd definitely recommend to seafood-lovers looking to share an appetizer .they come with a generous helping of bread , which can conveniently be dipped into the oft-gratifying mussel bath .potatoes : a crispy and buttery .i never opt for potatoes on a menu .never .but on valentine 's day with wonderful company , why not ?our waiter ( who was lovely , by the way ) recommend them and we embraced the yolo moment .neither of us are dessert people , so these seemed like a natural sub .finally , i 'll mention that the wine list here is frighteningly expansive .had we been in the mood for wine , i 'm sure the decision process would have been onerous .for a wine spot , the cocktails here were actually quite good .i had a rye-based drink and a rum-based drink , both of which were yummy .so overall execution here was great , but just not `` as good as it gets '' .it 's called the hall of fame ; not the `` hall of the very good '' .",8R16InoIf-JheYnh9EOR7w,New York,PO6lzwQbZzzyAZSpCUmcvw,L_d5qZjdVH7LWi7qnX_ipw

5,howlin-rays-los-angeles-3,"sorry gus 's , you 've had the crown for a couple of months , but now that i 've had howlin ' ray 's i need to dethrone you as the best fried chicken in los angeles .gus 's is good and all , but howlin ' ray 's is life changing good .albeit a bit more of a challenge , it 's also more of an experience .i 've had howlin ' ray 's on my list for a while , but because it 's only open from 11 am to 4 pm from wednesday to sunday , that makes it difficult , particularly because my friend warned me that on weekends the line can be upwards of two hours long .so , after working 17 hour days all week getting ready for a presentation and having the opportunity to go home at 2 pm once the presentation was over , instead of going home and going to sleep , i bee lined to howlin ' ray 's despite having already eaten lunch .i arrived at howlin ' rays at around 2:45 pm on a thursday to find a line of about 25 people , which was not intimidating at all given that my afternoon was open and i was prepared for the worst .while i was there , the line was never less than 25 people and probably went up to about 40 people at one point .i 'd say that it was a 30-45 minute wait ( to order ) for anyone that came on a thursday within a couple hours of closing .personally , i waited about 30 minutes to get to the front of the line , with which my phone to entertain me , felt like nothing .it helped that i was n't starving .when you get to the front of the line , you order from a person via an ipad / square and get a number .from there , it took about 15 minutes to get my food .inside , there are three high tables for two people each and about seven seats at the bar in front of the kitchen .if you come with a group or are n't lucky enough to snag a seat inside , there are plenty of picnic tables outside .unless you sit inside , your food comes in a box conveniently packaged to go , but i recommend eating it hot and fresh .if you are lucky enough to snag a seat inside , that 's where the action and fun is .johnny zone , the owner/chef ( from gordon ramsay 's at the london / nobu / bouchon / la poubelle ) will personally hand you your food , which you eat on a paper placemat .you can even get pickles while you wait ( but i am not a pickle fan ) .from my seat at the edge of the bar , i was able to watch johnny and his team do his thing .he calls out every order to his team who respond with `` yes chef '' and hustle to put it together .as each order is ready , he personally hands it to each customer , either saying `` welcome back '' or introducing himself , asking each customer 's name , and shaking their hand .here 's someone really invested in not just his business , but in making sure that each customer has a good time .it helps that he 's quite charming and easy on the eyes ; ) okay so enough about the experience , let 's talk about that fried chicken sandwich .it 's not just the best in the city , it 's the best anywhere .it ca n't even be placed in the same category as any other fried chicken sandwich that you 've had .it 's basically a huge breast with some bread and fixings to complement it .and complement it they do .the chicken itself is perfect , hot and crispy and just moist enough and oh so flavorful .i opted for the hot which was perfect .someone else said to go with what your gut tells you and knock it down a level , which was the perfect advice .my gut said x-hot and hot was perfect .it helped that jonathon gold recommended the hot .now , i am a huge fan of spicy food and have a very high tolerance , finding most `` spicy '' things to not be spicy enough , and found the hot here to plenty spicy , and the perfect combination of being spicy without distracting .i 'm sure i could have handled the x- hot or even the howlin ' but i probably would n't have enjoyed it as much .i 'm guessing that the average person should get the medium .because this was my second lunch , i was planning to eat half and take half home , but it was so good that i ate the whole thing because i knew it would n't be as good later .it 's a lot and probably could be shared between two people - but why would you want to do that ?is it worth the hassle / line / drive , etc ?absolutely .parking tip : they validate !be sure to present your parking ticket when you order .she gave me three 30 minute validation stickers when i had been there for 45 minutes at the time that i ordered , which was more than enough time for me to comfortably get my food and eat it .i had a bit of a hard time locating the parking from the street - it 's the underground lot for far east plaza - which has a very narrow ramp from the street to enter and exit from .make sure to check the arrows that you are going in the entry .",bVthsfeUU3Bd5AeJLqKT-w,Los Angeles,EzgWLQhTJmQulWXOdHX4wg,3uirStr0MsFaorCZY4GReQ

? ?it honestly looked and tasted like the cook grabbed a handful of salad mix from a package , sprinkled some tomatoes for color , threw a salmon patty from costco 's frozen section onto the griddle , left it there till it looked 'done ' , slapped that sucker on top of the veggies , and squirted the kraft thousand island dressing into the cup .voilà , far east joint 's salmon salad .popcorn chicken , came out as a soggy , bland , chewy disaster .the sauce which tasted like a thinned out thousand island with a hint of sesame did nothing to salvage the popcorn chicken .if you 're going to serve popcorn chicken in 626 you have to at least make it taste better than the saddest ghost town boba shop in 626 .kimchi fried rice , i had to try this bc as a korean this is one of my signature not-so-junk food , junk food dishes i make for myself/friends/family .it was n't bad in that it was n't disgusting , it lacked depth in flavor , maybe it was the kimchi they used ?overall , i think , it 's okay for places like west covina where korean restaurants are scarce and neighboring cities like rowland heights have barely decent offerings themselves .bacon fried rice , i think they used sweet rice/short grain rice , either way , the rice felt undercooked not that it was still a hard kernel , but still a smidge too firm that it kind of hurt going down .while the fried rice itself although having smokey bacon , overall it was a bit too mild in flavor for me .spam and eggs sliders , i have a bone to pick with people who order these .as i did not order this dish but someone else in the party did .my rating on fej is not based at all on these sliders bc to be honest every place that makes and serves these make it pretty much all the same , which does not take some elaborate recipe or skill !which begs me to ask the people who order these , are you that freaking lazy that you ca n't fry up some eggs & spam then throw it on king 's hawaiian rolls at home ?if anything.at least fej puts slices of cheese in theirs .i heard that the owner 's fiancé cooks pho for this place and would really like to come back to try it .i think it 's pretty cool that they 're serving pho in a different setting than your typical pho restaurant .supposedly though , we ordered everything that pinky 's friends never mentioned in their recommendations and pretty much ignored what they did recommend .so maybe that was our bad , but why even have items on the menu if they 're not going to be as good as the other stuff ?this is a nice addition to west covina which seems like a city on a mission to become more hip and happening , i just think this place needs to tweak their recipes a bit more and i really hope they do bc their cause is so honorable !",Jmx3acL7JIgB3vY2qrQNWA,Los Angeles,sK5KEpSj_SNrQSZ0XtNIgA,AHob23YCergMcxpfcedUfA
1,morgensterns-finest-ice-cream-new-york-2,"a unique creamery tucked along a side street in soho , morgenstern 's dishes up a number of flavors but none that really knocked my taste buds into overdrive .i did n't find the ice cream to really be worth the special trip .i tried several flavors , including angel food vanilla , madagascar vanilla , peppermint vanilla , raw milk , and vietnamese coffee , standing awkwardly in front of a growing line in this tiny space .none of the flavors was anything notable and the differences in the vanillas were very slight ; none stood out .the vietnamese coffee was extremely strong in coffee flavor , and not at all sweet i decided to try a madagascar vanilla milkshake after hearing reading various reviews that this shop has the best in nyc , while my friend got a scoop of peppermint vanilla .the milkshake was not very good , tasting just a plain vanilla milkshake in a weird consistency that was lumpy and icy .the scoop of peppermint vanilla was half-eaten because it began to taste like vanilla ice cream with toothpaste in it .the prices are somewhat higher than most , too .for the flavors and the chunky milkshakes , these prices do n't seem warranted .our server was very nice , but it took an extremely long time to get samples and our treats .there were only two servers working -- one working the register and one making the flavors .as we stood waiting for our treats , i saw that the flavors were being mixed in tubs .the tubs were filled with just basic vanilla and coffee ice cream , with the differentiating ingredients ( like caramel for the caramel coffee and crunch pieces for the coffee crunch ) just mixed in right as they were being scooped .even for my sample of vietnamese coffee i got a spoon of coffee with a slight drizzle of condensed milk on top .what happened to making a full tub of the flavor then scooping out of that ?maybe this shop 's sundaes are better , but i wo n't being finding out .after visiting a number of creameries in new england , this nyc creamery does n't live up .sorry , morgenstern 's !scoop ya later .",X2CfMLXq937zxuqq1_wDEw,New York,TsPZcaZyqPpFLOjKpMSSsA,bf-sSiiEoqPcpZQJqw4D2w

2,ooki-sushi-new-york,"tried : spicy crunchy salmon , ooki roll , fantasy roll , viking roll .all the rolls were much smaller than at other restaurants .i was shocked at how small the special rolls were , especially because they were $ 15-16 each .i appreciate that the rice was minimal , but the amount of fish was disappointing .spicy crunch salmon : taste was as expected , nothing spectacular ooki roll : spicy tuna , king crab , eel , avocado , crunchy flakes , in sesame soy seaweed , w/ eel sauce the largest of the special rolls that we tried , but still smaller than the average special roll .the sesame soy seaweed had no special flavor .it was the best of the all the rolls we tried , but still a 3.5/5 .fantasy roll : soft shell crab , avocado , cucumber , topped with spicy tuna and eel sauce .i did n't taste the softshell crab because the piece that they included was so small .it was 90 % flour & 10 % softshell crab .the spicy tuna was the predominant flavor of this dish .presentation was better than the taste .viking roll : spicy king crab , asparagus tempura topped with snow crab .the predominant flavor of this dish was the snow crab on top , which was neatly piled ontop .presentation was more impressive than the taste .service was courteous .they made sure our glasses were always filled .overall , the quantity of food you get is definitely less than other sushi restaurants in manhattan -- i would have expected to pay $ 11-12 for the special rolls for the size and $ 4 for the size of the spicy crunchy salmon .",MhFvAoV_oJGkGd6cVTAfAg,New York,xoToEuX26fpouNKZtV6cfg,gWmYa6uIAmQ_rhHAA_bZ5Q

3,musha-restaurant-santa-monica,"thanks to fellow yelper akiko i 's invitation , i came to this long time bookmark to meet her for dinner after remembering helen k 's stellar review .i was thankful to get to the restaurant before the crowd as the space quickly filled up soon after we got seated .given its proximity to the promenade , i was n't expecting the antiquated décor , but the good vibe in the air that coupled the festive ambiance gave the front door bar , subdued yellow walls , dimmed lighting and rows of tables a sense of character and charm .our meal started with the ponzu duck ( $ 6.80 ) which came with small slices of duck breast surrounding a bed of daikon oroshi topped with tokyo leek and ponzu sauce as the baseline flavor that brings it all together .the flavor of the ponzu was more pointed than usual , but the chilled duck breast was dry , and too thin and small to encompass the tender qualities like the ones i 've experienced at furaibo .the spicy tuna dip ( $ 8.95 ) arrived with squared rice crackers with a side of chopped spicy tuna sashimi .the tuna was mildly spicy , not too fatty and i thought it could have chopped into larger blocks instead of the mushy texture .the rice crackers were nice and warm to offer an interesting concept for the tasty snack .as starters , i thought the concepts were refreshing , the dishes had decent execution , but i was n't wowed by the flavors or value .one of the highlights of the night has to be the tanshio ( $ 8.95 ) , which came with thin slices of beef tongue and a small portable griller for us to cook at the table .it 's a very simple concept that is easy to make at home , but the meat turned out very tender with good flavor supported by a side of sweet and zesty lemon sesame oil similar to what you 'll find at many korean bbq restaurants .i also enjoyed the sakekasu salmon ( $ 8.95 ) which was grilled after steeped with miso and sake overnight .the salmon had good moisture distinguished by a background sake flavor which i thought was the best dish on the table .the dish that we both were disappointed with was the musha fried chicken ( $ 7.95 ) , as it arrived not too oily and nicely seasoned with soy sauce , sake , ginger and garlic , but the quality of the filet was poor and the batter was visibly peeling off as the pieces were lifted for serving .i also noticed some of our dishes were dependent on the combination of grated daikon radish and ponzu sauce which it could work for a while but not as the primary source of flavor that keeps emerging throughout the meal .overall , there were some minor degrees of wow factors with some of the qualities and values that i perceived as suspect when price is considered .on the other hand , they do get around these issues with some interesting concepts such as the tuna dip and the use of lemon sesame oil to keep the meal interesting .as a comparison , i do n't think the value we got was the equivalent of places like furaibo , and the taste is simply not as refined as yabu or exquisite as kappou gomi .however , it is still a decent place for locals and tourists to check out in the promenade area .service was friendly and attentive at first but sporadic once the place was filled .to their credit , akiko 's lemonade was refilled several times but there were also moments when i had to waive for someone to attend to our needs.a solid restaurant for snacks and small dishes with some minor flares here and there to render the average rating with a moderate endorsement for local diners .it was a good enough of a meal that will eventually bring me back to check out their pork belly and sashimi items .",0juzbrgcLHqobdK-OZAyiw,Los Angeles,NLo7PbJnjsTWbyc_6WRV_w,8KqiLE22mvPUZPv0_93A5Q

1,cafe-arte-new-york,"since opening up 1-2 months ago , café arte has been displaying banners to celebrate their grand opening with a $ 7.99 lunch special to entice the general public to come in .like many people who were looking for a deal i got suckered right into it .the café is pretty small and only offers take out .for lunch , the selection seemed decent : ramen bowls , burrito bowls , tacos , bibimbaps .everything was pre-made .if you 're ordering something cold then they hand it to you immediately .if you 're ordering something hot , then it 's usually ready pretty quick as well .more important than the food selection was the quality .and it was terrible !i 'm one to rarely complain about food or not want to eat something i bought , but the bibimbap that i ordered from here was so bland .the rice was not cooked very well and the additional ingredients ( beef , cucumbers , carrots , etc ) were blah .it was one of the worst café lunches i had ever had .i was so thankful that i got a discount at $ 7.99 , but even then i felt ripped off .i do n't like writing negative reviews , especially ones as bad as this one , but café arte needs to shut down , re-group and come back serving 'real ' food .not until they sort out their food quality issues would i give café arte a try again .",m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ,New York,z7NJHHAPe56lyhHLY5kjAg,Gr10cbQ-ehtwqUeTDExMxw

3,melrose-cafe-los-angeles,"only tried once on a whim , but i look forward to trying it again .ordered the ever popular ahi tuna salad , a calzone , and a large t-rex pizza .my boyfriend said he really liked the salad , but he only finished half of it and never finished the rest -- yep , i ended up throwing half of that expensive salad away .so , i think maybe it was not as great as he claimed or it would not have been as fresh past 1 day .the calzone was pretty delish .i love calzones .always have -- since my elementary school days .this one was dough-licious and huge .the ratio of filling to dough was off , as i prefer some parity or more fillings than dough .however , not embodying a perfect calzone , i enjoyed this take on a calzone and would order again in the future .the pizza is the main reason i can not give a 4* rating .i could tell that the toppings were cheap , which made the whole pizza very mediocre .naturally , most places in the food industry get the cheapest goods possible , but in no shape or form should i be able to discern such cheap quality .unfortunately , the meat thrown on this pizza was awful .the crust was also not great .i prefer the crust at several ( obvious ) pizza chains .that said , i think i might try another pizza .maybe a chicken pizza or a simple pepperoni .",fsKOJJAKMgv1KygGrm_X7w,Los Angeles,KVnND3-Vqa5l5j5FUZsHBQ,mKjRNHPlh34kwqSEQQ428w

4,natural-selection-healthy-grill-arcadia,"when my friend told me he was heading to natural selection to eat a meal by himself for the second time that month , i had to look up just what natural selection had to offer .natural selection is known for having healthier options , especially for the more athletic individual - seeing the location of this place .it 's located right next to a rock climbing gym , and in fact shares the bathroom and corridor with the gym .if you walk through , you 're able to see rock climbers .it 's also across the street from rei .definitely attracting the healthy lifestyle eaters .the location is pretty tough to find .if you 're driving down santa anita away from temple city , the restaurant is located on a corner to your left .if you turn into the lot , you can find a good amount of parking spaces .the restaurant itself is pretty nice .there 's plenty of tables inside , but they have a very quaint outdoor patio area filled with greenery .it 's definitely a good place to sit , relax , drink some healthy smoothie before heading back into the real world .immediately upon walking in , i got a vibe that this place focuses a lot on healthy choices - maybe it 's the ambience and color , but it 's pretty amazing how the look of the restaurant was able to do that for me .their menu is not the most simple - you pick from a wrap , bowl , or a salad ( and each option comes with different sides that you select ) .then you pick your `` flavor '' .so if you 're craving something more sweet and tangy , you could go with sesame , which comes with a list of set ingredients .after you choose the flavor , you pick the protein that you want to go into your wrap , bowl or salad ( they do have vegetarian options if you do n't want meat ) .if you want to go for something different , they offer breakfast burritos and sandwiches ( served until a certain time on weekdays and all day saturdays ) or grill sandwiches .there 's additional sides , soups , coffee , smoothies if you want to order more .one of my friends went with the mediterranean salad and a fruit cup on the side since she wanted to go for something healthier than what my other friend and i tried .the ingredients in the mediterranean are definitely what it sounds like - feta cheese , cucumbers , hummus , etc .and she had a veggie patty instead of meat .she said it tasted pretty good - but for me , i did n't like it .it reminded me of a savory yogurt on salad .the vegetarian patty was okay , but the other ingredients were not something i enjoyed .fruit bowl came with kiwis , grapes , and cantaloupe slices .i really liked the fact that they had fresh kiwi !normally do n't see that in fruit bowls , but these are probably seasonal .my other friend ordered a pesto sandwich and traded half of her sandwich for my sesame chicken wrap .the pesto sandwich was off of the grill menu , and she had the soup of the day paired with it - a tortilla soup .i 'm a big fan of pesto and i do agree that the pesto chicken was tasty , but it did taste super , super healthy .healthy in that there was n't much flavor to it .i thought the bread was a bit too dry , and while the ingredients tasted good together , this was n't the best pesto sandwich i have ever had .the tortilla soup was incredibly salty and despite it having a good amount of ingredients inside , we could n't finish it all because it was so salty .i definitely think the sesame chicken wrap was the best thing out of our meal - at least in my opinion .this comes with mandarin oranges , cilantro , almonds , carrots , onions , and sesame dressing - all of which went really well together .chicken was more juicy than the pesto sandwich , and i liked the sweetness of the oranges , the crispness that the cilantro gave , and the savory-ness of the chicken .went super well together and was a super good size .it came with a fresh spring salad with a vinaigrette .nothing special , but it was n't bad either .-they do have free wi-fi , and i saw several students just studying here after eating lunch .-complimentary self-serve water cups .-if you like them on ig , you get a discount on your check .-pretty secluded place that does n't seem to get too noisy .definitely a good place if you want to just hideout for awhile and study or relax .tl ; dr - i think foodwise , i 'd have to give them a 3.5 , but i really liked the restaurant and the whole healthy vibe they have going on .the workers are also incredibly nice and helpful .we had a ton of questions and they were super patient !i would n't mind coming back and trying something different or one of their popular smoothies , which i 've heard was really good .but definitely would recommend the sesame chicken wrap if you 're looking for something to order !",t3cu9DxXtGyaPIWNvPOXxA,Los Angeles,eyrXj6aNgX2SvJ0MtfHDWA,IxaXBuxfW8VXpy4idreiFA
1,tamarind-new-york-4,"coming from an indian person .hear ye , hear ye , thy unbrown person .there are two types of indian restaurants in america- 1 .indian food for non-indian people : great decor , spacious , pricy , with a small menu of items described in great detail .kofta becomes `` vegetable balls '' and the desserts arent indian , perhaps merely to spare them the difficulty of describing them .2 .indian food for indian people : the spice is strong , the service is questionable .the waiters are of indian origin and will have a hard time understanding you .a chicken tikka masala shalt not go by any other name .this is a strong type 1 .the fact that everyone here for sunday brunch besides us was n't indian is telling enough .we 'd come here for winter restaurant week 2016 which promised us a $ 25 brunch .excited by the fact that not one , but two entrees were promised , we thought it was a decent deal .it was n't .lies .lies and deceit i tell you .alas , we discover that $ 25 is no special price , but the price of their regular weekend brunch .marketing at its finest .and lo and behold , two entrees is n't the two indian sized grandiose bowls of spicy ambrosia , but two minuscule portions of curry served alongside a soulcycler 's portion of rice .if only the luxurious decor could fill the rest our stomachs .i exaggerate slightly , but let 's talk taste .type 1 indian food to the core .the portions small , the flavors mild .they were kind enough , i will say , to bring us complimentary pakora [ sic ] .that is pakora in the singular for they brought us one measly soggy onion pakora .the lamb appetizer was undercooked and almost mistakenly doused with saunf .when recipes are perfected for centuries , one does not simply add a random ingredient .the shrimp appetizer was decent though , i 'll admit .calling the main courses lackluster , would be an insult to the word .the meats - chicken and lamb were horribly undercooked .the fish , edible .the kofta , or `` veggie balls '' as the menu would say , were decent too .let me tell you something about palak paneer .palak is spinach , not kale .i repeat , spinach not kale .you can not simply substitute the age old green leaf of popeye with your next trending health item .not cool , bro .and those two entrees , like i said , are misnomers .they were appetizer sized .onto dessert .the black forest cake and the creme brûlée were n't bad per se , although it would be equally strange to see gulab jamun and rasmalai for dessert at a french restaurant .one thing michelin raters look for in food is consistency between different dining experiences .granted this is hard .one would at least expect consistency within the same dining experience .two creme brûlées .one deftly torched on top , was served to my friend .the one served to me , raw .alright , the best of us make mistakes , one might think .after taking a bite , i politely asked the waitress why the brûlée was n't torched .i did n't ask for custard .when you 're laying $ 30 for a meal you expect an apology and a replacement .this is n't pocket change .instead , she asks `` oh , you like your creme brûlée toasted ? `` .i was a tad aghast .why do n't you serve me some dough and tomatoes and ask `` you like your pizza made ? `` .`` duh '' .without apologizing , she takes my dish away promising to return swiftly .as she does .i found peace in the knowledge that this grave error would soon be rectified by a new piece of tiny , yet sumptuous new torched creme brûlée .nope , they torched over my half eaten wow .this meal was forgetful , and for a post blizzard new york brunch that we all travelled a ways to get to , downright disappointing .not to mention more expensive than was warranted .tamarind once had a michelin star , a star it has lost not without reason .lest you 're craving the sanctity of a completely counterfeit white-washed meal where the dining tables are more expensive than a months rent , go to curry hill and grab yourself some real desi food .amen .",PEEtVBaYZD_wpsTDMI9viA,New York,xHygtnGMr6Cv7cxYlSadQQ,oXbPk8NybjEXd2F_pDjJ-g

2,five-guys-south-san-francisco-2,"a good flat top burger , but not a great value for $ 13 bucks or even $ 9 .it 's a new burger place and i have heard some decent thing about five guys in the past .so a quick bite to eat was in order after a trip to a nearby osh hardware .five guys looks inviting enough as you drive up .once inside it looks remarkably similar to another well known california burger place .i opted for a bacon cheeseburger with everything on the side .i wanted to see the burger first and then self-assemble the components .i also wanted the bun extra toasted .plus small coke .it is true they cook your burger to order .i was lucky enough to get a seat where i could watch the action .five guys also has a box of peanuts you can dip into while waiting for the rest of your food passed on the peanuts .mainly because they were n't mentioned by the person taking my order .also because i did not see see anything to scoop the peanuts into .while waiting for the burger to arrive i walked over and filled my drink cup .five guys has a pair of those newer cartridge-based soda machines .the kind where you use a touch screen to pick the kind of soda you want .i am not a fan of those machines .despite the fact they are supposed to offer an accurate product , i have usually found there is a bit of syrup left dangling from the previous user that alters the flavor in my cup .they also seem light on carbonation .same experience with the machine at this location .the soda flavor is not their fault .but the choice to use that kind of soda machine versus a regular fountain is their responsibility .when burger came , it came in a bag .did n't matter that i was eating in and had told the staff this .all orders are bagged regardless if it 's to-go or not .at first i was disturbed because it seemed like a wast of many items .later i was relieved it was bagged because of the fries .bacon cheeseburger : beef : soulless flavor from the flat-top grill .but otherwise good quality and decent quantity .cooked as i ordered .bun : toasted .but not extra toasted as i had asked .veggies : nice and fresh .all on the side .that included grilled onions on the side too .good job in packaging them up in a foil wrap , sauces : missing many sauces .just got mustard , ketchup , and mayo .asked for them all on the side .cheese : a good quality american cheese .a pair of slices came with my burger .bacon : a rather cheap quality bacon and not much of it .way overcooked .came more as large bacon bits rather than strips of good bacon .a fail !cajun fries : the fries are the reason i am glad i got the order bagged .part of the fries were in the cup .the rest were at the bottom of the bag with everything else sitting on top of them .about the quantity i have two ways i can look at it .one : the cup size was way small for the price .two : the cup size is way too small for the order .either way there is something wrong with the way five guys sells and serves their cajun fries .the quality of the fries was excellent .if there is anything done right by five guys , it is their cajun fries .i would consider coming back just for an order of five guys cajun fries !staff : person taking my order was friendly and accurate for the most part .he did forget to put extra-toasted for the bun .this was reflected in the bun as delivered .people making my order were friendly and accurate for the most part .but they plainly forgot several sauces i had asked for and shown on the order receipt .as mentioned the fries were all over and under items in the bag .make a point to check your order every time before you leave .you can not count on staff accuracy .also check the order to guard against giant grease stains on your car seat if you take your order to-go .the floor staff kept on top of sweeping the floor and wiping down the tables .he also made sure the order pick-up counter was clean and well maintained .other things : the men 's bathroom was clean .no problems sending kids in by themselves .tables outside if you want to eat outdoors .two , to-go parking spaces provided for people who call in and pick-up their orders .nice !something i found disturbing .reviews were plastered all over the place .( bathrooms too ! )like five guys is still trying to convince you your choice was a good one even after you had already decided to eat here .worse still is they were all just directly stapled to the wall instead something nicer like being framed and hung .i 'd rather five guys leave off with the propaganda attempting to pass of as decoration .it just makes the place look cheap and also leaves me wondering if i had made the right choice in coming to eat here .overall value : we have loads of great burger joints in the area .paying $ 13.38 for a bacon cheeseburger , small fries , and small drink feels overpriced and underdelivered .what i received .not the worst for the sf bay area so i 'll give them 2 stars for now .( 2 1/2 if i could )",yR731OlfuI4585U4_HhHlg,San Francisco,rb7CBAHqu2-8WWLvD5tPQw,iB1ClRrbXgWZKhuC6EMqfw

2,alcove-cafe-and-bakery-los-angeles,"with its cute garden , decorative furniture , feel-good music , red umbrellas for shade , all-day breakfast/brunch menu and thousand reviews , alcove cafe seemed like the perfect al-fresco brunch spot to kick off the last day of a three-day weekend .i really wanted to fall in love with alcove as it held such promise from the reviews i had read and the beautiful pictures of the location and food that were posted .however , my experience at alcove has left me overwhelmingly unhappy with the experience and i dare say we will perhaps never , ever see each other again .as many reviewers have described before me , hungry dine-in hopefuls line-up to order at the counter and receive a number to place at their table for their food .all drinks , cakes , cookies and other deserts should be picked up at the counter prior to sitting .water is self-serve and cups , lime , orange and lemon wedges can be found to counter left of the cashier .once all drinks , cakes , cookies and other deserts are obtained , the hostess will aid your party in finding outdoor seating .if sitting indoors , seats are usually more readily available .the process of ordering/receiving was not really explained -- as a matter of fact none of the service process was explained to my party .while it is granted that a lot of the customers are return customers , there should be a clear way to explain how their system works to new patrons .needless to say , our cake was not sent out with our drinks and i had to apologetically blame my n00b ignorance when asking the waitress about our cake .thankfully service here is great and she reluctantly brought the cake to our table .i 'll admit that the whole ordering process left me a bit miffed as i did not understand how this order at the cashier process , pick up drinks then approach host for seating business facilitated faster service .my friend and i ordered the brioche french toast , crab cake eggs benedict , princess cake , orange juice and cafe au lait .brioche french toast - dusted with powdered sugar and served with a side of butter , maple syrup and mixed berry compote , the toast was light and fluffy .the mixed berry compote was a bit too tart for my taste .i did n't particularly enjoy it .crab cake eggs benedict - served with two perfectly poached eggs , nestled on top of a bed of blanched spinach , crab cakes and focacia bread , the dish was lightly doused in hollandaise and sprinkled with fresh chives .the taste was definitely good but was again missing the spark to make it exceptional or memorable .after a couple of more bites i found that the focacia was heavy , hollandaise sparing , and the spinach bland as it took away the taste from the crab cakes and hollandaise sauce .the crab cakes were delicious , fried golden and seasoned to perfection and the eggs perfectly yolky .needless to say , i ate up most of the crab cake and eggs and left the focacia behind .the dish was served with fresh seasonal fruit which i found to be a nice touch .princess cake - a layered cake of purple fondant , whipped creamed marzipan , and raspberry , this was definitely a different creation in comparison to their blue velvet or red velvet cakes .at first bite , the cake tasted good when all layers were eaten in one swoop .however , when eating layers , one by one , one realizes that the cake is rather dry and grainy .the only saving grace was really the marzipan and the raspberry .at $ 7.95 a slice , i found it to be the most sorely disappointing dish .i also found the coffee to be watered down and terrible .even asking for more coffee did n't make it better .if a coffee drinker , be sure to ask for expresso rather than a regular coffee .all of our items did taste ok/good , but not exceptional especially for the prices we were charged .all of the food we ate rounded out to nearly $ 50.00 including tax and tip , which i consider to be an astronomical price since we 're eating brunch , and not even an all-you-can eat brunch at that .although , the food admittedly made me feel like i ate at a buffet as it left me feeling heavy and icky after .aside from ambiance , presentation and location , alcove cafe 's food is mediocre at best and does not do justice to the price tag it warrants .if you want to dine at a restaurant and pay the real-estate for a cute al-fresco experience , this restaurant is definitely it .if going for the food , skip it-there are better brunch spots with better food out there .",j78OeM6cLZ3OsFlJwwOgpA,Los Angeles,XktlKlJX_ieqmDTpfRBkfQ,vV6T6qxuZrx2hWw2f-PKpA

''i thought normally they come covered on top .my first impression was the dumplings do n't look good .they looked like they collapsed in shape not appetizing at all .they were sticking to the paper but that is ok. then i took the first bite and right away my taste buds kicked in .dumplings were doughy with thick wall .also , there was something , spice or flavoring that i was unable to pick that just did not taste good for me .i ate 8 pieces out of the 10 trying to find out what was that taste because i was afraid to ask , i swear .so i thought it could be one of the two if am not wrong .dill or vinegar .but the i have to say i did not enjoy eating at all even i ate 8 or them for a reason .ice tea===it was milky , sweet and tasty .i really wanted more but .the service : this was the bad part of the entire visit next to the dirty windows and the dumplings .i am not going to generalize but i have to say this , but what is it with some asian restaurants ?sometimes i feel that they are not happy you are coming to dine at their place !i can never figure this one out .however , the invisible lady or the hispanic man , bothered to come and ask if i needed anything at all .refill ?oh by all mean i will pay for second refill.water ?oh maybe we are rationing due to the drought .but , slamming the check with the lousy fortune cookie on the table without saying anything at all , not even thank you or how was the food was outrageously terrible .it is time for these people to learn some manners , know how to treat people otherwise get the hell out of any business that has to deal with the public , period .the verdict : the three stars are for the beef chow mein , that is all .i will never step a foot on a place like this again .i have never ever left a place without leaving a tip , even when the service is bad .but today , it was the beginning of zero tip .this is a new policy from now on that i will adhere- `` no service , no el tipo . ''i really could have given this place one star easily .i think 3 stars is too generous on my part but i really hope they can read or someone brings this to their attention so they can make some adjustment .",ZKQNtvyVrZ_HlGt330EdDQ,Los Angeles,KHzx5pjsxbepAEwkB8lAzA,wN7swB8yvE1WoM9dl9gg3w

''i would highly rename this watery artichoke soup on bread .the white was the only edible one .it was very dry , a sign that it 's been sitting for a long time and put in the for oven too long .there was not enough ricotta and it was in desperate need of some oil and herbs and flavor .the bottom of the crust was also burned and i could not eat it and only scrapped off the top .this really made me think about the terrible consistency this place has .how were two pizzas burned and one still watery ?i was extremely disappointed , especially with the hype surrounding the place .my expectations for italian food are very high because the flavors are so simple yet the key is to use fresh ingredients and use the right techniques to make it the right way .artichoke was a huge let down .the waitress was so embarrassed of the kitchen she did not even dare check on on us because she knew the pizza was disgusting .she did however take off the nasty burned stuffed artichoke from our check and i pray no one will ever order it .whoever calls this good pizza probably has never had a slice of 99 cent two bros , which is astronomically better than artichokes .i will never come back to this location .so over priced to pay 17 dollars for 2 slices and a square of `` pizza .

4,homeskillet-san-francisco,"rating : 72/100 pts i decided to come here for breakfast after giving up on dottie 's just around the bend , whose serpentine line was moving at a snail-like rate of 10 feet an hour .although it is a full service restaurant ( though they do have a takeout option ) , you order at a register before sitting down , allowing for fairly quick customer rotation .they have a variety of breakfast categories : eggs/toast/bacon combos , eggs benedict with hash browns/tots/greens , sandwiches , pancakes , french toasts , as well as a nice selection of drinks , and a separate menu for lunch .after much deliberation , i decided to split the chorizo eggs benedict and french toast + spa service with a friend .the benedict was awesome : perfect eggs ( still gooey in the center ) , generously laden with hollandaise , all over an english muffin , pork chorizo , and mixed with bell peppers .great quality ingredients .the hash browns were also perfectly fried , and were excellently complemented by the hollandaise that dripped over the eggs .the french toast was good too , though a far cry from amazing ; definitely more homely than lavish .the bread was a bit thin and less substantial than one would expect given the price .( $ 7.50 just for the toast , an additional $ 4 for the fruit/pecan toppings and whipped cream . )being a self-proclaimed french toast expert , i 'd recommend sticking to the egg dishes , or perhaps venturing into the pancake zone .as an aside , some of their plates have this san franciscanly pretentious hole on the side .when i went , they happened to have put the whipped cream right next to the hole , so it tragically dripped out and onto the table as i ate .the coffee is bold and highly recommended .( $ 3 , self-service and refillable , several varieties . )overall , though perhaps not quite strong enough to stack up to some of the more well-known ( and consequently , heavily customer-barraged ) breakfast/bruncheries in town , homeskillet has a strong case for itself as being an alternative to spending your entire morning in line .recommended dish : chorizo eggs benedict + coffee",zAEL-X8wc4cHZ5tAom82IA,San Francisco,0Xg1JQPIa4BvHLdocXjcyg,5hUS_V9vsYU1EZmq1NwZ0g

3,redfarm-new-york,"i 'm gon na give this place a solid 3.5 stars , simply because the food was n't what i expected it to be .husband and i had read about this place a while back , and when the ny times covered it , we decided that the next time we were in town , we 'd give it a try .the concept of asian fusion dim sum was interesting , as we anticipated the menu to have a diverse range of flavors .overall , the flavors were pretty good , though on the sweet side .i 've never been a big fan of purely sweet tasting dishes , so imagine that your entire meal had that taste ; it gets overwhelming quickly .we started off with a citrus-flavored scallop ( $ 12 ) , a special for the evening .there were 4 in one order , and they were tiny .in spite of this , the flavors were cool , refreshing , limey , and the sweetness from the scallops had a nice umami flavor .after that , our choices from the menu started to arrive .the flavors of the pork and crab soup dumplings ( $ 12 for 4 ) were good , but a little difficult to eat because they were so big .if you do n't have a good handle on chopsticks , this can prove to be a challenge to eat without having the soup spill over your spoon .a few people next to us were experiencing this , and i felt bad for them !pacing of the food was good , as there was ample time to savor each bite that we ate , especially with the dumplings .we also ordered the crispy duck and crab dumplings ( $ 12.50 for 4 ) .served with a curry vegetable stew in the center , the flavors were nice with the combination of dumplings .by this time , we were starting to get full , but we still had 3 more plates .the diced lamb with chinese broccoli & white asparagus ( $ 28 ) had a rubbery texture and the sauce was too sweet , tasted just like sweet soy sauce ( kecap manis ) .the vegetables were plentiful and fresh , but the with the sweet sauce overpowering the natural flavors , it became inedible fairly quickly .the same goes for the short rib fried rice that we ordered - just too sweet .however , the shrimp , scallops , & mussels with rice wine , tomato , basil & very thin rice noodles ( $ 28.50 ) was very well done .probably the best dish of the night .the broth was flavorful with the sweet basil and the shrimp were prawns ( do n't even remember the last time i had prawns this big ) .nice , sweet and plump , they went excellently with the broth .add the lovely flavor of mussels and it was very aromatic .we finished eating in about 1 1/2 hours , and there was a long line out the door of hungry people .we read that we should arrive close to opening time ( 5pm ) , so we did and boy are we glad .i would highly recommend coming at that time , or you will have to wait a good 1 hour or more , as the place is small , and they seat people in intervals .good concept and fun farm to table asian fusion place , but i wo n't be coming out of my way to come back here next time .",dmRueUwj0JMTlNZfTj3ZWA,New York,_PYakO2iNxLhg4bCjvlMYg,sGIkHQObgrqQo8o3CHDEqg

4,farmshop-santa-monica,"***farmshop is a great restaurant for upscale seasonal cuisine ; while some of farmshop 's entrees and desserts could be better , their salads really showcase their ability to create flavorful food with produce at peak season*** when i first tried farmshop , it was a good seasonal brunch and lunch spot with a artisan bakery on-site .since then , farmshop has expanded .dinner was added as was a gourmet market .the new market is much bigger than the larder and pantry at nearby tavern .their market features fresh produce , fresh meat , ice cream , wine , chocolates , spices , pasta , sauces , cheese , dairy , and very gourmet deli sides and cooked meats .it is really a small grocery store with very impressive product ( though it is expensive ) .for dinner , farmshop offers a family style menu and an a la carte menu ( on sunday , it is family style only with fried chicken ) .farmshop 's family style menu consists of a starter , an entree with two sides , and a dessert .their a la carte menu is a traditional 3-course menu .i have had both family style and a la carte at farmshop and their starters ( specially their salads ) really shine .one salad was wild arugula with sunchokes ( both roasted and as chips ) , indigo rose tomatoes , rancho gordo wild rice , and goat 's milk feta cheese .the other salad was frog hollow farm emerald beaut plums with red mizuna , creamy burrata , oregon hazelnuts , and celery root salsa verde .both salads were very seasonal featuring juicy and peak season plums and great fall sunchokes ( they were also very evenly dressed and seasoned ; flavorful but not wet like you get with a lot of salads ) .both salads were also among the best salads you can have in los angeles -- definitely up there with lucques .the sunchoke salad was a unique take on sunchokes since they served them more like roasted potatoes where you can really enjoy their unique texture -- too often sunchokes are cooked down into a puree for a creamy side or a soup .the burrata salad was great .the plums were incredibly juicy and lightly sweet and they went well with the very creamy burrata .the entrees showed potential but were not as good .the fried chicken was very juicy .i liked the crunchy crust too .it had a fair amount of spice and heat to it .it was good , but it was not as addictive as some great upscale comfort food dishes i have had elsewhere .i also had the seared sea scallops with celeriac puree , brussels sprouts leaves , trumpet royal mushrooms , and black grape glaze .the dish looked great and i liked the garnishes ( though i would have liked a more delicate and less rubbery mushroom than trumpets ) ; unfortunately , the scallops were very over seasoned .they were were big , juicy and very soft , but the salty crust kept the dish from being great .sides with their family style menu included celery root roasted with cauliflower and endive ( good curry flavor ) as well as braised wild greens with pomegranate and walnuts .both sides were good and flavorful .desserts are not a strong point at farmshop since they are primarily just using their desserts from their bakery and adding a few garnishes .i thought their pear walnut tart ( not on their bakery menu ) was pretty good .it included crispy puff pastry with a financier cake , pomegranate molasses , pear compote , and la creamery vanilla ice cream .the dessert was nicely sweet and and a good balance of different flavors and textures .the other dessert i had was cocoa meringue with mousse , spiced chocolate sauce , and cocoa nib .the mousse , chocolate sauce and cocoa nib were all good , but the dish was almost all meringue and i think meringue ( which can be bland and have kind of an off putting texture ) works better as a garnish than a centerpiece .service is great here -- quick , attentive and friendly .prices are high , but they do serve high quality food and generous portions .the decor at farmshop is nice and fits with the menu and service -- rustic , upscale , clean , comfortable , and homey .farmshop is a relatively new restaurant and its rustic and seasonal approach fits closely with the likes of lucques and now departed campanile .with many los angeles restaurants going the bold , rich small plates way like animal and manhattan beach post , it is nice to have a change of pace spot like farmshop .brentwood country mart has its own free parking lot ; it can be difficult finding an open space ; you can also find metered parking on the street or free parking in the nearby residential area .",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,Los Angeles,lj8cuMnoT6DaOj0fPhOioA,awu9PgVWfdIm1s9_8dKNIg

2,new-york-pulao-kabab-long-island-city,"so here 's the issue with fast food - it 's not always bad food , - your perspective really depend on your exposure to the depth of the cuisine in which it is found upon .pakistani fast food ?it 's a quick and often cheap way to fill your stomach with familiar flavors .typical fare is a cup of milky masala tea , some type of quickbread ( usually griddled on a tawa , or a turbojet-like tandoor oven ) , some type of meat , usually well chopped ( so you can add fat to it to stretch out the product , or moisten up poor cuts ) , either goat/lamb or chicken .then you get peas or chana , ( chickpeas ) , spiced and stewed , and available in certain joints ) .sometimes you might have a decent biryani with rice steamed over a spiced broth until fluffy .in new york , that type of cuisine is found in places where cabbies tend to congregate .a good amount of cabbies hail from the subcontinent , and they are under the gun looking for a quick place to refuel between hails .a hallmark trait is a fast , efficient counter designed to facilitate quick sales , a dispenser for masala teas ( pre-spiced , milk added ) , and almost always , a free public restroom .examples include the sorely missed pakistani teahouse near church and reade , and lahore on crosby near houston ( across the street from the now demolished bp gas station ) .the teahouse will serve you the protein-and-2 on starch with a small salad for 6-7 dollars , but they can also get you a chicken or lamb seekh kebab on a bread , both fresh from the tandoor , with garnishes for about 4 .lahore have their trays of pre-made stews on a refrigerated display case , which they spoon onto plastic containers with rice to warm up on a microwave oven .there are also bun kebabs , more like lahore style hamburgers , but with chicken and lentil patties .you basically order up , grab some water and spoon spicy pakistani pickles off a communal jar to go with your food .well , what about new york pelao kebabs ?not great .i looked at their shami kebab going - hm.this tastes a little too flossy for me , like there 's nothing substantial inside .well , that 's not the issue as long as it 's flavorful .unfortunately it contains alot of capsicum heat , but just not much in terms of variety .i found them rather bland , in fact .the issue also extends to the pulao special - the rice is bland ( colored , but no notes of coriander , no cumin , no garlic , no cloves , nothing else ) , the chicken is bland ( it 's colored with a red tinge but i do n't detect anything besides the green chile heat ) , and all i can do is pour some yogurt onto the dish to lower the scoville heat level a bit .overall everything tastes overcooked , with a heavy hand from old , musty past-sell-by-date spices , and lacking a certain dimension of saltiness .there was some cilantro chutney that you can ask for from the gentlemen behind the counter , but overall it was simply `` meh '' .that being said , my wife ordered the chicken tikka roll served with tandoor bread , and that actually came out to be the best of the bunch .the chicken tikka was decently flavorful , and the bread was crisp but soft interior , freshly peeled out of the tandoor and paired with the usual veggies , yogurt and whatnot .my guess is that if you want something good , avoid the rice and go for the seekh kebabs or tikka rolls .i will try them again when i am around that part of astoria , but i wo n't go out of my way for it .",EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw,New York,FpawTo6Tqt9ckeCbvJGG0Q,E9K51yS6vRmqMKagxlSmVA

2,locanda-veneta-los-angeles,"the dessert was divine .getting that far , however , left one a bit weary .dinette and i had early reservations ( 6:30 ) saturday night , happily finding street parking , which is the way i like to start the evening , which is worth at least one star in my book .warmly greeted , we were shown to a secluded duce-booth at the far left in front by the window - cordoned off from the main room by a short partition - dinette was pleased .it was our first time for dinner ( d had previously enjoyed lunch here with the girls- and insisted we return for an evening out ) .cocktails are not served , just beer & wine , which dashed my hopes for a fine juniper scented stress buster , but i would survive , or so i thought .opening the fine leather crusted `` la carta dei vini '' led me immediately to the conclusion that this fine establishment loved collecting wine even more than i loved drinking it , to which the bottle prices bore testament , -- so ridiculously high as to insure that none would be sold ( to us reg'lar folks anyways ) that evening , thereby leaving the house collection un-depleted and intact .wow - i think the most reasonable bottle was $ 65.00 in hindsight , this shock confirmed when our waiter , sensing my delirious hyperventilation at page one , suggested that if i could not find anything to my `` liking '' ( read : price range ) there were selected offerings available by the glass .okok , gim me a glass of the rosy .dinette started with the albacore carpaccio and i with the stuffed zucchini flowers , one of my favorite , as they are in season and fried !one of my many criteria for a skilled kitchen is how they fry - i was sadly disappointed .what should have been light and favorfull arrived as a plump , formless zucchini-/-corn dog , with a 1/4 '' chewy shroud of tastless oil soaked batter , strangling the encased tender flower-proud veggie .ouch.could eat only three of the four , as i needed too leave room for that was to come .d 's carpaccio was to her liking , save for the overdressing .my entree was the branzino , which i anticipated would awaken a lusty nostalgia for the branzino d and i shared on the grand canal , just steps away from the realto , lo those many years ago , but realistically i was prepared for much less , -and was not disappointed .it is said that the three secret ingredients of a restaurant are sugar , salt and butter.well , someone in the kitchen took the last of the three to heart .did i mention that d ordered the fettuccini de tartuffe ?fine home made pasta with an ample shaving of white summer truffles , drowning in a pool of clarified butter that would make ghee trader twitch .between both the branzino and the fettuccini we could have lubed a fiat and skeedaddled to the dolamites for a weekender .do n't know what the kitchen was thinking - maybe `` if a little bit is good , a whole lot more . ''i ca n't imagine .the ingredients were perfectly fresh , the fish was cooked to perfection , the pasta al dente , the truffles fragrant ( and plentiful ! )but , holy cow , my cholesterol would be hole-up in the penthouse 'till sunday noon !the upside was that , since it was impossible to finish such a rich meal , we took it to go .the next night we rustled up a potful of spago , mixed in the leftover butter-buffed truffle infused fettuccine and had the meal we should have had the night before !then came the dessert.and a giant leap toward redemption .panna cotta with berries , a lite cream sauce , and 'spressos.mmmmm !service excellent , ambiance nostalgically venice , food not quite there -hopefully an off-night , but for $ 200.00 .yikes.i donno .free parking saved the evening .~jr note : rreservations were made through open table that ( sat ) morning .sunday we received notice from o.t .via email that the restaurant reported we had not shown up for our reservation .whadup widat ?hmmmmm ?addendum - o.t .came through with the 100 points - tastey !",T7OSE81Rsl8aBbgqG0xn0Q,Los Angeles,rRNCujch3mpTRrBP4JdQqQ,fzmOZ5GW5DfBMtwmlKTWog

2,teavana-sherman-oaks-2,"when i first caught on to loose leaf teas , around 2003 or so , this chain was like a chunk of heaven .then i grew up , went to tea tastings and took a workshop on tea preparation , etc .after which , i some how fell in to buying my teas directly from importers .i got my mate from an argentine shop that only sold mate .i got my chinese teas from a shop whose owner goes to china every other year to purchase the teas directly from the families that farm and process them .i got my japanese teas from a tea house , and my chai from a place that also sold ( indian ) ayurvedic blends .so , for the past few years , my tea drinking experience has been pretty authentic .fast forward to a few months ago , when i moved to la ( with over a pound , total , of various teas ) .then fast forward to a week ago , when i ran out of all my teas.but i had enough for one last cup of traditional mate ( with bombilla ) , and one chunk of puerh ( enough for a pot of tea ) .basically , i was desperate , but too busy to drive to bird pick in culver city ( the only place i 've bought a bit of tea in la ) .so i opened my beloved yelp app , and searched for a tea place in sfv.oooo !teavana !in accordance with my fond memories of the place ( from when i first started drinking teas ) , i was stoked that it was so close .i went in , knowing i definitely needed genmaicha , mate , chai , an oolong , something fruity for guests , and maybe a matcha or sencha .i asked to see and smell all these things , but as soon as she opened the lid for most of them , my eyes told me the quality is not good , and i said `` i do n't want that '' .but she still wafted the aromas toward me and read off all the supposed health benefits to try to sell me on the teas !for each of them , i had to repeat a few times that i was not interested , for her to get the picture and close it so we could move on to the next .my eyes told me .sencha : too dark , very gray-black , and not emerald green .plus very small leaves , much like what you would find in a good tea bag.but not what you expect from loose leaf .genmaicha : primarily toasted rice , not so many tea leaves .the leaves looked worse than the sencha .pretty much what you would find in a regular tea bag ( not even a good one ) .mate : there was no traditional mate .it was all blended with greens , blacks , rooibos ( reds ) , or herbs and fruits .i would have settled for a fruity herbal blend , but there was not enough visible mate in there for me to even bother .i ended up getting a tulsi chai and some kind of oolong .i had the oolong this morning , and it would make a better potpourri than tea .you should go here if : -you love tea , and are just starting to break away from bagged teas .-you want to get a gift for someone who may or may not love tea .-you want tea accessories ( pots , infusers , water boilers , cups , sets , etc ) -you want to decorate with tea sets ( i swear , my mom does this !she has so many nice pot & cup sets from this place , but she 's a lipton lady.those are pure decoration ) -you 're trying to break away from coffee , but you 're not sure what teas you 'll like -you do n't believe my review and want to see for yourself .",ZiNgmN1wBbUzZNYzYvM1Wg,Los Angeles,W6dGnfJZMVAUNTC7sKsBng,wHUc3FskHecwudb-N2gkFQ

3,pizzeria-due-chicago,"for those who are familiar with the uno 's bar and grill chain , pizzeria uno is the original chicago deep dish pizza invented in 1943 .a block away from the original location ( still in operation ) , is this place - pizzeria due , their second ever location ( hence the name ) .unlike the bar and grill locations , the first two focus more on pizza and some other italian specialties and appetizers .we arrived for lunch around 1 pm on the saturday after thanksgiving , on a very big day for college football .there was a wait for tables , but i am not sure how long it was .the bar is not very big , but there were open seats there , so we decided to sit there for lunch .our bartender , dave , took good care of us , as did tera , who came a little later .at the bar , they had a variety of brews on tap , including a number of local ipa 's .i opted for the house amber ale , which i enjoyed .it was nice and sweet , hoppy , but not too hoppy .for starters we went with the house made meatballs , which were pretty good .they were slightly dry , but the sauce they came with was amazing - thick and hearty , nicely seasoned , with a little sweetness .just how i like it .it also came with 4 pieces of garlic bread , which was good for sopping up the extra sauce , because you definitely do not want to waste a drop !next , we shared a small numero uno - a chicago deep dish filled with extra cheese , sausage , pepperoni , mushrooms , onions , and green peppers - basically a chicago deep dish supreme .it was pretty good , but definitely not the best chicago deep dish i have had .the crust was really good .both the men 's room and the restaurant itself were really cramped , making it difficult to get in and out of your seat and move around .it was also extremely hot in there , as many places are arpund this time of year .they have some outdoor seating , which i an sure wpuld be really nice in the summer .but i almost feel like it is necessary in the winter , even just to step outside for some fresh air for a while .overall , i was pleased with the experience .there afe definitely many better places for chicago deep dish in and around the city .but it was definitely worth going to because i really like deep dish and italian food in general , and it is nice to say that i have been to such a historic spot !",7_UCrB0a2khEIFi480Gx-g,Chicago,xVagIVxB7BdtUkZ5rgsG6Q,IbYYFNt78uwp2eQ76-PhQQ

3,humble-potato-los-angeles,"in my humble opinion , this potato is alright .not great , but good depending on what you order .interesting japanese/american burger fusion with friendly service , a nice interior with fun giant robot-like graphic art and toys , some depth to the menu ( 4 different cheeses to choose from ) , and a long wait .i 'll give them a break on the wait as we were there at a busy time .tried the curry-baga , at $ 7.95 which comes on a nice big bun with angus beef , thick cut tomato , onion , pickled radish , and savory japanese curry .i thought it was very flavorful and good comfort food especially as i like japanese curry and i like it with hamburger .those red pickled radish added an additional tasty crunch .i tried a bite of my daughter 's tempeh-baga ( $ 7.95 ) and it was not good at all .the indonesian-style tempeh was like eating soft soaked flavorless nuts formed into a brown patty .i think it 's safe to say that if one wants vegan food then they should n't go to a burger joint .my mom had the katsu sando ( $ 8.50 ) , which is basically a chicken katsu sandwich served with yuzu-jalapeno slaw and tonkatsu sauce .it was kinda dry and kinda spicy .i would n't order this again , as well .the curry fries were good ( $ 3.50 ) .just standard frozen ( ? )fries with japanese curry on them but they are tasty .hp jasmine iced tea ( $ 2.50 ) tasted kind of like the sole of my shoe with a little sweetener added .bad batch or an acquired taste perhaps ?i 'll try the iced coffee next time as .while there is definitely room for improvement in their offerings ( e.g. , using fresh cut , quality potatoes so as to try to highlight the potato in the humble ) , i would go back for the curry-baga and to try other items on the menu like the the yakiniku sando , chicken curry meatballs , the battle royale , the mama san chicken salad , and the abocado shake ( ice blended choco-avo whirl ) .no alcohol , which is ok as there are sooo many places that have it that it is refreshing to not be blitzed by beer .park in the corner lot or on the street .",00umt4xnFvEWEN6vEc5RBw,Los Angeles,9AIPCScu9qiCMPEcteb0zw,nIjKDb9eEwOIozIj6GW3Mw

4,pho-18-ave-bensonhurst-2,"i would say that pho 18 ave is pretty decent ( i 've had some pretty bad pho before ) , and on par with pho tay ho on 86th street in terms of flavor , but a little less pricy .the best is still gia lam in 8th avenue , but that 's a review for another day .what i love about this place is that the decor is totally different from other pho places .i think we all can agree that most pho places have pretty much the same look - kinda dark and dingy , with dirty tile floors , green tablecloths , and a kinda gross looking piece of glass on top .this restaurant completely goes against what the normal pho place looks like , and opts for a somewhat classier and much cleaner look .there are private booths , as well as wooden tables in the middle which give it a sort of community table seating vibe .anyway , it 's a much cleaner look and i definitely prefer a clean setting while eating .taste wise , it 's quite average .the portions are gigantic , and the prices are n't too bad actually ( one of the cheaper pho places for sure ! ) .as usual , i opted for the largest pho bowl available ( dac biet i believe .but it might be the `` faw chea tuw '' , not really sure what the difference is honestly ) .the bowl is humongous , and it 's full of noodles , broth , and various parts of the cow .the broth was a bit weak in flavor , and gia lam is superior in that regard .additionally , the noodles were a bit too soft for my liking .the beef and cow parts are all standard .we also got a large order of the fried spring rolls which were quite good .the spring roll wrapper has a much deeper yellow color than other places , but the taste was good .also , i appreciate that they are generous with the lettuce .in other pho places i have to ration the lettuce to make sure there 's enough for every spring roll haha .we also tried the summer roll with beef .it 's a soft wrapper filled with beef , vermicelli , and lettuce .comparable to other pho restaurants , and it comes with a peanut dipping sauce .we also got a pork chop combo over rice which comes with a fried egg and chinese sausage .honestly i have no idea why anyone would even get this sort of dish at a pho places when you can kind of get it an any generic chinese restaurant .my disapproval was confirmed upon tasting the dish , as the pork chop was too thick and lacked the flavor of a traditional vietnamese pork chop .the rice , egg , and chinese sausage are literally just that - i would say avoid this ; why would you come to a pho restaurant for this ? ? ?we also got a dry vermicelli noodle with thin slices pork chop .it comes with the same dipping sauce as the spring rolls , so it 's super light and refreshing - perfect for a summer day .the thin pork chop here was much better than the thicker one of the rice fish , as the marinade actually permeated the pork .overall , a solid place to grab pho if you 're in the area .i do think it 's a bit better than pho tay ho , but still under gia lam .",WJsK__tI1iFAhXPxgL-76w,New York,Ws8ph5sg-WhuRTiPU_ghBw,k2Wk5g4fEfUIKkDFH8op4g

5,han-yang-buena-park,"there was a sf yelp talk thread recently about what kind of comfort food you are craving when you are sick ( other than soups ) .while i did n't contribute to that thread , it did make me wonder ( but not in a led zeppelin stairway to heaven stoned kind of way ) .for me i know what i want.but it really depends on how sick one gets .if you are bedridden , i doubt you can drive over your favorite hole in the wall and eat some m $ g 'd up bs ( whether it be chain shop faux pho , or your tried and true moo shoo poo poo doo doo joint , or a shop that uses m $ g water and rice to make broken rice congee ) , and bs wo n't comfort you in the long run , even if you can tolerate it immediately .it 's like that episode in 24 season 1 , girl 's arm was broken and thugs gave her cocaine to numb the pain .sometimes one needs little to no excuse for the good simple stuff made with love and care .if going back to basics , liquid food is mostly what one needs to reset you , whether it be a tiring day after work , or in this case , a hard day of traveling .i personally am not a michelin star chaser like some of my food friends out there , because the higher the expectation , the harder the fall ( and potential disappointment ) , and it can be such a hassle at times ( what ?you did n't make a reservation 2 months+ in advance ?you $ uck ! ) .with a neighborhood eatery that delivers , i can just show up whenever i want , order off the menu , and know i will be in for a treat , and walk out happy like a wolf in a bacon store .han yang is a soup specialist restaurant , i guess we can categorize that type of soup as gomtang , or soup made with meat , bones , and in some cases rare cases , parts .sometimes that is all you need.a personalize pot of soup with stuff in it , some side dishes to go with it , a bowl of rice just to fill you up ) .more fun if you have good company and drinks to go with it , unless they do n't want to be with your sick ass .came here couple weeks back one weeknight , almost half hour before closing .simple two page menu , in korean.english.and.shorthand ( mainland ) chinese ? !whack .the table had two condiments only , salt and pepper .3 kinds of banchan , but very good quality ( similarly to kunjip in norcal santa clara , which operates just like han yang , except they have naengmyun , no donkatsu , and has galbi jjim ) .kimchi ( baechu ) is as good as it can be , but i prefer the kimchi daikon cubes for its pristine clean crisp texture where the spices were not overpowering , and a nice balance of mildly sweet and tender sour .the kimchi leafy green was a little bitter , not quite my style but interesting nonetheless .before the soups arrived , a plate of ginger citrus dip ( for the meat and tendons ) came .along with big self help jar of scallions ( oh yeeeeeeeeah ) .galbitang - on par with kunjip 's version , maybe slightly heartier .it 's interesting that if you search for kalbi tang or galbi tang in yelp for garden grove ( or buena park ) han yang is pretty much the # 1 return in search result , and it 's no surprise why .a truly enrichening broth , sweetened a little by what appears to be a dried red dates , a ton of scallions , ridiculously tasty bean thread vermicelli ( the kind used for good jap chae ) .and the beef ribs were very interesting.not your usual typical kbbq galbi cuts , but more like `` meat on a stick '' renditions that i had not seen before in norcal.and uber tasty .one dip in the ginger citrus sauce and it 's magic .but what i really enjoyed a lot more was dogani tang - ox knee bone tendon and cartilage soup .this one is more up my alley.ox bones boiled down to a consistency of creamy but light delicious consistency .you add salt to self season .i guess pretty much that is seolleongtang , but slt usually has beef shank slices .if you are more of a connective tissue lover , then dogani tang is the way to go .delicious tendons , stellar bean thread noodles .add salt , and as much scallions as you want , and this is very fulfilling .wish i brought my own himalayan pink salt , this would elevate it to great heights !now if the kitchen could provide authentic shandong style hand pulled noodles and throw it in , it would be the best tw style clear broth beef noodle soup ever ( after adding some shanks in ) .good polite service , no nonsense food .chase all the michelin stars we want , but at the end of the day , we know ultimately what delivers for us at the end of the day and what makes us really happy and smile big .",DS0Idr2XDhz5e7ZfSy0dYA,Los Angeles,dSOiOURBRw1X2sdtiLlSxw,9cha3bYW2dc2J4HxOn7Xww

2,yoji%C3%A9-japanese-fondue-los-angeles-2,"yojie was recommended by a few friends of mine so i decided to give it a try .the pictures online looked great so i figured that i couldnt go wrong .we parked at the parking lot across the street as mentioned in the yelp reviews .fyi , its not a nice parking lot .it doesnt look very safe for that matter so i 'd advise walking with a friend .however , it is nice that they validate for parking .upon entering , we took in the beautiful atmosphere .it was very serene , modern , and hip .after reviewing the menu , we ordered 2 shabus with the toriniku ( chicken ) and geisha ( 5 oz angus beef ) and 1 sukiyaki with the seafood combo .after ordering , they turned on our burners to put our pots with our broth on to boil .each pot can carry up to two sauces because of the divider and it seems like each table has two burners .shortly after our food arrived along with a side of udon and veggies .while i love shabu , i felt like their was lacking a bit of flavor .i asked them for hot sauce and they provided us with a drop of their `` habanero reduction sauce '' which was actuall pretty spicy .however , it still did nothing for the flavor .after dinner , we decided to go for the green tea fondue that everyones been raving about .i found it a bit expensive for strawberries , bananas , and white choco/green tea .$ 8 !really ?plus , the fondue quantity was very little .while i understand that they dont want to waste it , it doesnt really draw in the crowd if its less than an inch high .i dont think i 'll be returning again .there are plenty of other shabu places that better suit my taste buds .",M6yt65wCj5Q73BBHcFxIVg,Los Angeles,XYFHeFsp3H8d-leviO5wUw,KjAoNXJYyip5HDyhSTwYfw
3,pizzanista-los-angeles,"there 's a lot of hype around the pizza here , due to their instagrammable macaroni and cheese slices they only offer on sundays .but tonight my companion and i tried their $ 2 tuesday slice night , and their thin crust new york-style pizza was only okay .i found the crust to be way too tough and chewy as each bite demanded some serious strength to eat .i could n't even chew the ends of the pizza .i was also annoyed that my pepperoni slice was tiny compared to everyone else 's slices !even my vegan cheese pizza slice as double the size .what gives ?i do , however , like that they a ) offer the $ 2 tuesday deal in the first place ( for 3 pre-selected flavors tonight -- cheese , pepperoni and vegan cheese ) .slices are normally $ 3-4 each on the full menu of flavors b ) are loud and hipstery in a really seedy part of the arts district .there 's community seating .it feels cool.but it 's impossible to have a conversation inside .c ) have fancy sodas like abita root beer and craft beers in a refrigerated case d ) sell clara 's cakes , a vegan bakery owned and started by a teenager ( ! )in la .i 've heard about clara at vegan fairs , but she does n't have a store so it 's impossible to get her stuff.lo and behold they have her cupcakes here .e ) are vegan friendly , offering pizza with daiya nut-based mozzarella shreds .the vegan slice i had was overcooked so the cheese was too hard , but i was glad for the effort .they even have nutritional yeast on each table , a vegan staple , to sprinkle on your pizza next to the regular parmesan and chili flakes .try it out -- the nutritional yeast naturally tastes lightly cheesy and has a ton of added nutrition .f ) their pizza sauce , which they sell by the glass jar , is awesomely flavorful !",IL7s7BR8DuoOFwYYM6cZ7w,Los Angeles,HZwLA7WJwnTtL2KmV5bmVA,kIbte2WfpearB4EY_wUG_Q

3,the-snail-thai-cuisine-chicago,"been to many a thai cuisine spot , but this is my first time in hyde park .it was alright overall .i was surprised at the rather small portions , i guess i have been spoiled by many of the thai places i have frequented all over the mid west since 1987.also surprising was the fact that one does not automatically get rice as an accompaniment to an entree , they charged $ 1 for a small bowl .the appetizer we tried was the steamed version of the pot stickers ( filled with ground chicken and vegetables ) , not terribly impressed and the dipping sauce was nothing to write home about .when it came to the main courses - one of wished to opt for the red snapper prepared in red curry sauce but were informed it would take at least 45 minutes to 1 hour to prepare and serve that .disappointing since it was approximately 8pm already .no where ont he actual printed menu did it caution us about this .oh well , so we chose the bahmee ( sp ? )with chicken , this was decent & not bad at all .the other entree we picked was tilapia red curry .they had mango bubble smoothie which worked well to appease the palate at the end of the meal .",0iF2SMtDR125gXCRycsmJg,Chicago,O3dxDLFmA2_oawUta0Fc4Q,p4T2Jd-8z_XmEXkto73s2Q

2,chaamlex-new-york,"like many other yelper stated.i had a big debate on what to give this place.but sadly i will have to give them only 2 stars and here why : 1 ) horrible service 2 ) unorganized - more like i think they are under staffed especially during the lunch hour 3 ) some dishes were amazing.but then some where disgusting lunch wait = ridiculous -we were the first people there for lunch , but the last ones to order , wtf !i get that everyone that came in was ordering to go and were sat in , but even when we tried ordering at the register , the waitress made us sit .-on the plus side we did get our food at a decent time , but it sucked that we were waiting for a while to order ( ~15 min ) .-after we finished eating , we waited forever just to get someone to give us our bill , so again we tried going up to the register to pay and she told us to sit down , she brings us our bill , but then never comes back for it .we wait and we wait , then finally we just went up one more time and made her ring us up .what i think they need to do to improve is to have someone working on the togo order and another person working on the sit downs .the lady seemed so overwhelmed because she had to do everything and even answer the phone calls for togo orders .here is what i tried : 1 ) lunch special bao moo deang -do not get this dish !-it was very bland with no flavor .the soup taste like water with salt in it and the noodles taste like grain .the chasu ( bbq pork ) was decent , but not as soft as i would have liked it .it was more sweet than i am used to , but unfortunately it did n't add to the blandness of the soup .-i tried even added a sh*t load of hot sauce , but did nothing .-this was just too disgusting that i did n't eat it .rather could n't bare to eat it .2 ) lunch special pad see ew -this totally makes up for the dish above !-this is probably one of the best pad see ews that i have had in nyc .bravo !-they made it sweet however , if you like it that was and it was very flavorful .-portions were decent as well .i got full over just half of it and without eating the dish above .for the appetizers .1 ) shrimp dumplings -undercooked , the wrapping was too mushy and thick .it was quite small and made the `` lunch special '' see , useless .you could n't really taste the shrimp either .2 ) egg roll -this was actually not bad .i like the sweet and sour sauce it came with .it had a great crunch and it was fried perfectly .hip music -they played your every day top 100 , hiphop , edm , etc .it definitely blended well with the venue .venue : -it was very cute with a chalk board and a combination of wooded bench sits with pillows and tall chairs and tables .we wanted to sit that the tall chair tables , but the waiter would n't let us because it sat 4 and there was only 2 of us .ugh.we ended up sitting by the door .i think lunch time is not the ideal time to go to this place unless you are taking it to go .",9VVJ7GUnV4b_pmpAKzIflQ,New York,FWC6o0KTwxtd25z2wtd4vQ,Rqvn5FH6X0z07jO-s99noQ

''and shes looking around for my receipt and shes like `` i will make it right now '' and i got a little pissed because i didnt see anything on the grill that looked like my food .i sit back down and give her some more time and then i went back to her to ask again because my son was driving me crazy .and she tells me to go to the front of the store and speak to the man at the register .when i get to the register there 's the man who ordered the 4 shawarmas and he isnt even behind the register hes standing right next to me eating his wonderful sandwich .he asks me whats wrong and im like i have been waiting way too long for my food while everyone else that came after me is enjoying there 's .i dont think that is right .hes like ok let me see your receipt ill go see whats wrong so he takes a look at my number and he goes to the back and tells the cook why shes taking so long and to hury it up .then , i was like i dont want the food , it isnt fair for me or for my son to be waiting this long to get some food .i would understand if everyone else got there food late , or if there was a problem .but clearly there wasnt.so then i asked for my money back and hes like ok dont worry we will give you your money back and you can take the food also .then while im waiting , this other guy shows up at the register and asks me whats going on and the man thats standing next to me tells him what happened and hes like let me go see whats going on and he comes back with a nasty face saying `` oh you ordered chicken kabob and shawarma that takes a long time to cook '' and i looked at him like are you serious ?is this the excuse you are going to give me ?he puts my reciept on the table and he goes i m not giving you your money back because your food is ready .i was like all of a sudden.now ?my food is ready ?hes like yeah look its right there plated on the table.i was really upset at this point.he had his food in his hand while he was talking to me and so did his friend .so since he wasnt giving me my money back i asked to have my food packed to go .and he became so nice out of no where .he took my plates and gave it to the woman in the back to pack .i got my food and i went to my car .so i open up the boxes in my car about to start eating and i notice how old the chicken is and the rice too .i even took some picture to show everyone what kind of quality this place has .then i open up the second box and i see chicken kabob and im like ok this looks good , i take my first bite and the chicken kabob is raw !yes raw !i was so mad !i not only wasted my time but $ 30 !anyways , as you can tell from many other customer reviews this place is a shame .unorganized , inattentive , dirty , no customer service what so ever .",Y_5otFXakA51OGewqq66IA,San Francisco,1hHpf2JGDz2AV2rPERCCRA,LXwex_QNSKApcyqPUNPj0A

5,breakroom-new-york,"the hype is legit at breakroom .on a street dominated by viet and thai restaurants , breakroom shows no backing down by offering cheap and delicious mexican and bar fare .there are two things that will amaze you here .first , their crazy topping combinations and second , their collection of every hot sauce known to mankind .the challenge to try every single hot sauce along the wall is downright masochistic .breakroom burger ( $ 9.95 ) - it 's an understatement when i say the breakroom burger is the best burger i ever ate .picture a perfectly seasoned huge burger patty under a thick slab of braised pork belly under a runny fried egg under a fried onion ring under melted cheese .each bite was like a make out session with the burger .and with each bite , drippings of burger juice and spicy mayo pour out .amazing .( 10/10 ) caution : might break jaw breakroom fries ( $ 6.95 ) - almost the same treatment as the above burger but on fries and tater tots .so much is going on in the mouth with each bite as you get an explosion of flavors from the cheese , jalapeno , mayo , and whatever hot sauce you poured in .( 9/10 ) taco platter ( $ 9.95 ) - you get a choice of 3 different tacos from ( fish , grilled steak , cheese steak , pork belly , chipotle chicken or veggie ) .my friend tried this one so i do n't know how these are .but if it 's anything like the burgers and fries , it should be awesome too .the great service of the staff was displayed during my hot sauce experiment .i found the spiciest hot sauce ( dave 's gourmet insanity sauce ) and my tongue was dying within seconds .i broke out in cold sweat and starting panting .when i asked for water , the cashier gave me a cup of milk instead .that certainly saved me from a few extra minutes of pain .",UQjTQILOVELefNtL3rczfQ,New York,lTQ_cTOXBOfYsMGzUpTtpQ,MYaZN8dQdkYulvcXPcJ1Eg

5,le-petit-paris-los-angeles-3,"this is my second time here but before that i want to provide the first time experience which was for a celebratory dinner with good friends jesse and andy , and patronising pastry chef @ danielaviktoria from instagram .my drink was the 2010 château lacombe noaillac , bordeaux - smooth was the overall verdict , which it was .it comes a close second to the bordeaux i had on top of the eiffel tower .jesse ordered a vodka/soda water ; and a bottle of badoit water for andy .we started with the following appetizers : heirloom tomatoes - creamy buratta cheese , pistou and fresh basil ; gravlax salmon - with chive cream and house made blinis ; and the pièce de résistance - house made duck foie gras - with exotic fruit chutney , toasted fig bread ( da bomb ! )the first two appetizers are quite fresh and good .however , i have to say that the highlight truly was the house made foie gras which was `` quite a heavenly experience '' -- as agreed by both me and andy , who is a gourmandise .our entré consisted of : meunière sole - with mixed seasonal vegetables for jesse , and the 34oz dry-aged côte de beouf - served with himalayan ice salt , 3 sauces ( gorgonzola , bernaise , pepper ) , gratin dauphinois , sautéed mushrooms for myself and andy .if you are a meat lover you have got to try this , to share of course .the presentation of both dishes was done table-side and quite a procession and a show in itself .we finished our meal with the chocolate mousse with berries .if you are a chocoholic , this is good for sharing ; and the vanilla creme brûlée was mouth watering good .kudos to pastry chef dani who made me quite proud .overall , my first experience , and shared by my group was a resounding - `` a must repeat experience '' .compliments to the establishment for bringing a refreshingly new french restaurant that adds to the diverse palate of los angeles , and to chefs cazes and baptiste for the good food .oh , and our server , lucas , who had us as his first table serve , did superb !*** today , sunday , 18-october , 2015 , early dinner *** so , now for the second experience .i started with the bordeaux , château lacombe noaillac which is now my favorite red in l.a .i ended ordering two glasses of that should tell you something .i started with appetizer , burgundy escargots - dressed in garlic and parsley .the flavors were just perfect as either flavors of the garlic nor parsley overpowered the other .i followed it with the bouquet of shrimp - mixed greens with house made mayonnaise .very fresh .entré was lobster papardelles - with artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes , in lobster cream .i was not overly crazy with this one probably because by the time i ate it the pasta was overly cooked and the cream was all melted -- it came out the same time as the shrimp/salad and the host having noticed it going untouched offered to place it in the warmer .it was all just timing .dessert was le verrine - two alternating layers of lime pannacotta and mango-passion fruit gelèe , topped with white chocolate balls and petit cubed pineapples and decorated on top with edible gold foil and pineapple leaves .this was quite very refreshing with good complimentary flavors specially after the shrimp and lobster in cream .overall not a bad experience once again , just a matter of timing recommendation as to when the entré should have been placed and brought out .this place is a must try and highly recommended !",DwTXncSA_d0yiTV_oj6U7w,Los Angeles,_mXaDPIHcwTKY7BcCss9og,nQ0cbwQIREvzZhla8kW69Q

''i ordered the bouillabaisse and enjoyed the variety of seafood in the dish but it also had the same tomato-y , salty flavor to it as the pan seared fish -- it was a little uncanny how everything felt like it was on the exact same note .i also had a problem with how salty the bouillabaisse was .my dad initially ordered the squid ink tagliatelle and asked for it to be softer than al dente but it still came out overly firm ( consistent with my previous dining experience ) and there was n't much to it besides tomato sauce and again , a lot of salt !we mentioned it to the staff , who were so accommodating and professional and offered to replace it .he ordered a bouillabaisse like mine and requested it to be light on the salt but it still came out salty .all in all , not the most satisfying meal .5 stars for the service and the dining area but honestly , i would n't come back again for the food , which does n't really leave much else to come back for at a restaurant .",fSAb-HB99d4KxlIXN1gyrA,Boston,522GifodDtVcHI1U_kFk-A,iddrL47XM-IcLX9khWwjMg

it was alright .the kale one was a little better in my opinion and i think went over a little better with the group mains - gnocchi - we ordered two for the table and came close to finishing them because they were excellent - great flavor and texture flat iron steak - we asked for it medium and it came rare .so , i did n't like it very much salmon - one order , came with lentils , we had a lot of lentils leftover so i do n't think it went over that well lamb - one order and i really liked it but we had about a third of the order left over short ribs - we requested two orders because pretty much everyone said they wanted to try it ; mistake .it was probably my favorite item , but even so , as a group , we probably ate the equivalent of one order amongst the whole group .i really liked the plaintain gnocchi in it gringo burger - we had one member of the party who did n't want to eat the rest of the items so he chowed down on the burger and said it was excellent ; it came with fries and it was an entire separate giant bowl of fries - enough to share with all 7 of the rest of us !his burger was huge too so the food was a mix in terms of flavor satisfaction etc .but i will say all of it actually was more than ample portions and reasonably priced .so do n't go crazy and over order .maybe even under order and then decide if you need to order more , because it will be a lot dessert - was also talked up a lot on yelp and was very disappointing .the horchata crème brulee had very nice and interesting flavor but it was smothered in too many berries which masked the best part of a crème brulee , which is that crispy sugar top , and the overall consistency was wrong - it was n't thick enough or creamy enough , it kind of fell apart too easily , very disappointing .then we also got the chocolate bread pudding .the bread pudding part was not great .it too , was smothered in too many berries .the best part was some chocolate `` paste '' in the bowl .that was excellent .i asked a few in the group what rating they would give and i got back 3.5 or 3.75 .that 's about the range i feel as well .but , of course , i can only give whole numbers - 3 or 4 - here .i 've thought about it for a bit and i 'm going to go with the 3 , because there is definitely room for improvement .",hPfOBL96kAgsnm-J3Jvu3w,Los Angeles,uXk9kcwjC-Z7x-zh1L2AQQ,Fs--VyrKKOStw5T9rOMG7g

2,carsons-ribs-deerfield-deerfield,"gluten-free review -- arrived for a late lunch on an early february tuesday around 2:30 at the deerfield ( il ) location .it was probably the first time i had been to any carson 's in at least a couple of decades .except for us , there were no other customers .we were seated in the bar area .service was n't much of an issue , because the bartender came out from behind the bar to wait on us .he could keep an eye on us as he was setting up for the evening .and we could signal him , if anything was needed .since he had no gf beers available , i started with an angry orchard cider .carson 's does n't have a real gf menu per se , they just have a gf diners ' clarification page that lists , dishes that are gf , some dishes that can be made gf , gf ingredients , condiments , and exceptions , on what they call the gf menu .( see image ) i also found out , it 's not complete in what adaptations might be needed for some dishes .btw , there also is no pricing on it , so you still need their regular menu .i 've noted before that this kind of arrangement makes ordering a chore .you need to constantly cross-reference between the page and the regular menu to figure out what you might like and what you can order that will be safe , plus to see what comes with what .the explanation page is nowhere near complete , so additional questions will also likely be necessary .they had no gf bread for sandwiches , so that eliminates a whole category from the menu .that 's something that should be corrected , at least for the sake of lunchtime orders and lighter eaters .after struggling with the menus for a while , i settled on a salad -- as my wife already had .she got the chicken cobb and i the sliced steak , after i was assured their roquefort dressing is gluten-free .she enjoyed her cobb , which had a decent amount of cubed chicken breast pieces .my steak salad turned out to be a meat lover 's delight , but the rest of my salad was mostly iceberg lettuce with little other vegetable ( just red onion ) .( see image ) the taste of the meat and dressing were very good , but it was a higher fat and calorie amount than i was prepared to have , especially at that time of day , so i used the dressing sparingly and took home a portion i did n't finish .it certainly would have been nice to have more varied modest options available , like sandwiches with gf bread and fries that are gf .it seemed as if gluten-free diners are just dealt with , as an afterthought , rather than catered to .in other words , .`` we have our menu and this is how we can adapt the items we 've chosen for the main public to you , but we 're not going to do any more to adapt or replace any of the lighter fare items from that menu that you ca n't eat . ''or , .`` we do n't care if it 's lunchtime or you 're not hungry enough , here 's our dinner-size entrées you can order from . ''also for the prices of those salads , iceberg lettuce was cutting a corner that should not have been cut at this type of restaurant .there should have , at least , been romain lettuce and/or possibly some mesclun or other leaves in the salads .over the years , we had gone to carson 's for their chicken and ribs dinners , and that was fine in its day .but in today 's market some things need to change to stay competitive .now fine diners are more gourmet conscious and are no longer happy with too basic of recipes , meals that are unbalanced nutritionally , or getting ingredients like iceberg lettuce .and many of us are more health-conscious too .there need to be more options available here for this market .just because i have to eat gluten-free , does n't mean i do n't care about these issues like many others do .however , putting those weaknesses aside for the moment , the quality of the ingredients we got were good .but the gf experience is n't where it needs to be here .",ghvirdDL1CtFzZWeRa-Glw,Chicago,5kES9-jmEtkJGx8XQy2r8A,PbVgBsnTi0HUAcqL65dG-Q

''the entire time because i felt like i was on a farm trying to squeeze my way through tourists , protestors , and policemen .listen here !you do n't mess with 2 hungry women when they are hungry !( see pictures here : alturl.com/angd8 ) the policemen would not let my friend and i cross the street since they were barricading anyone from entering certain streets .havana central was on one of the forbidden streets that i was trying to get to .i was determined to get down that street !i just remember my mom teaching me since i was young , to use your beauty to get yourself out of certain binds .so i made my friend take off the hideous scarf wrapped around her to keep her warm and fluffed up her hair and i had to take my hair down and flirt with the cops just to let me through .and voila !it worked .boy would my mom be proud .( insert sarcasm here ) okay enough about all that .let 's talk about the restaurant shall we .this place upon entering is lively , loud , and crowded crowded crowded .you want live music ?come on a saturday night at 9pm , that 's when the music starts to play .but do n't expect a seat right away .but if you want to get a seat.then come before 7:30pm to guarantee a spot .the music is set up at the entrance at an awkward spot so it 's not necessarily at plain sight if you 're seating in the back .the service here is great .we had a beautiful hostess whom i forgot her name , i think her name was damyana or something of that sort .we had a short conversation and she mentioned that she 's a model/actress .she looked like she walked out of the tyra bank 's show `` america 's next top model '' .our waitress was amy and she was uber sweet and patient with us and very attentative .as far as the food , it was decent cuban food .i ordered the pork lover 's combo ( $ 19 ) .it consisted of pulled pork , pork chicharron , and pork ribs with rice .it came in a 3 tier food stand which was cool to look at but not practical to eat from .they give you a small bowl of rice which i would eat from with my pork.but the bowl was so small .i think it would have been practical to give you a plate to transfer the food to .out of the tier , the pulled pork which is considered the `` chef 's mom 's recipe '' in the menu was probably the best thing i ate here .it was so moist and tender .the chicharron was the worst !it tasted like it was pre-fried.then refrigerated.then re-fried again .it did n't have the crispy texture that chicharron is expected to have .instead it was just so dry , un-edible and rock hard that i practically lost a tooth !they need to improve on that .the pork ribs were okay , not the best , but eh-okay .my friend ordered the roast pork mofongo ( $ 15 ) which comes with the same pulled pork that my 3 tier had .we would have ordered some alcohol with our order but were thrown off when it costed $ 40 for a small pitcher of sangria .what ? ! ?a decent bottle of sangria only cost about $ 12 .now that was the cheapest pitcher they had .the other pitchers costed $ 55 !holy crap !i could buy a pair of shoes with that money !so i passed on the booze and settled for a cappucino .we ordered the tres leche for dessert which was pretty good ( minus the whip cream ) .they used two different kind of whip creams on the tres leche .a dollop of cool whip and canned whip which had a very weird combination in taste .i say.stay with one or the other , not both .cool whip is better .if i would judge this place on food alone , i 'd probably give it a 3 .but because of the excellent service and live music.i give it a solid 4 .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ price for 3 people - 3 entrees - 3 drinks - 1 dessert -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - total $ 77.30 ( that does n't include the tip )",#NAME?,New York,cIsgPSRiCIUGkdJ3MlgliQ,95UHMsuTUJKT3nF-5BpF9A

3,le-coq-rico-new-york,"restaurant week winter 2017 i have been wanting to check out this new french place in flatiron and it was a bit of a let down .pros : - service was a+ .the waiter and the manager kept walking around the restaurant asking if everything was alright and how were the dishes , and refilling our drinks as needed .- decor was very modern .i thought the blue and white fitch painting in the restaurant looked pretty cool and representative of their restaurant .the okay : - deviled `` eggz '' ( tuna ventrèche & cabbage salad with cumin ) .presentation of the dish was very beautiful but in terms of flavor there was nothing special about it .tasted like a regular boiled egg to me and flecks of tuna and a bit of cabbage salad .3.5 stars - butternut squash soup ( orange and ginger ) - presentation was a+ as usual .soup was good but nothing out of the ordinary .3 stars - plat du jour quarter chicken with a small seasonal green side salad - i have heard amazing things about this chicken from all the press and media but it fell short of my expectations .the chicken was aged 110 days ( brune landaise ) but i did n't really taste anything special or out of the ordinary from the chicken .they have a jus ( sauce ) that comes with the chicken and you definitely needed the jus for the white meat since the white meat was a little on the dry side .there was only one drumstick so that was the only piece of dark meat ( best cut in my opinion ) that was n't dry .the salad was good because you definitely needed some veggies besides just eating meat .3 stars - l'lle flottante ( soft meringue & creme anglais ) - this was the better dessert out of the two .it looks amazing as well .there was a sugar crust ( similar to a creme brulee ) on the top layer of this dessert and it was delish .love the crunch and there was additional crunch from the thinly sliced pink almonds .there 's also this big ball of fluff floating in the middle of the creme brulee .it was like eating marshmallows .4 stars cons : - baba au rhum , chantilly cream - this was basically rum cake and cream .i did n't like the rum cake .the rum was too strong for me especially the part where the cake soaked up all the rum .1 star overall : i would n't come back here .the chicken was over hyped .",eA0VHBJgTvf0aUReQkTi3Q,New York,OrzxCROCIMgQbQwFs6IEbw,PronFrzQEiiFxIf6_WH0YQ

2,swan-oyster-depot-san-francisco,"it was a beautiful sunny weekend , just a tick past 11 , and no traffic to be seen .what better time to try swan oyster depot ?parking was surprisingly easy near polk , although only for a 1 hour meter maximum .given the stories of the long wait , i was a bit worried about having to make multiple trips to the meter god , but the siren call of `` the best seafood in sf '' beckoned louder than those worries .already a line had formed and the small , cozy place was bustling with activity inside .multiple people arrived as we waited ( ~20 minutes ) to pick up to-go orders and i have to admit i was a bit surprised about some of the tabs ( over $ 100 ) .still , with the sun glowing warmly , waiting in line was definitely a nice experience and one i 'm surprised i had never experienced while i lived in the city ( though i probably could n't afford it then ) .people drank beer as they waited and most chatted pleasantly with each other .the couple in front of us had driven all the way from santa barbara and had been going to swan most weekends since they were children .all in all , good signs .after the quicker than expected wait , we made it to the counter and proceeded to order the dishes most in line had recommended : clam chowder soup - brothy and strong , with no hint of milk that most are probably used to with other chowders .the chowder was an excellent start before all the cold food and was notable for the minimal amount of potatoes .oyster - a variety of 4 types , all of the oysters were extremely fresh .i was a bit surprised at how small one variety was , but i know next time to just order by saying `` give me one dozen of the biggest fellas . ''definitely as good as hog island ; points for the abundant selection of sauces : red onion-vinegar , cocktail sauce and horseradish .prawn cocktail - for $ 8.50 , it was essentially four cold prawns in a glass .reasonably fresh , but i was a bit disappointed given the high price and lack of preparation .unless i live in the boonies and do n't have access to fresh seafood during the winter months , i ca n't imagine what 's so special about this .in fact , i can go to safeway , pick up a 1 lb bag of prawns for $ 21 and make 10 of these cocktails .combination salad - for $ 17.50 , the salad consisted of lettuce sprinkled with a generous helping of crab , shrimp and prawns .dressing choices are oil & vinaigrette or the famous louie sauce .pardon my ignorance , but is n't louie sauce just thousand island dressing ?it sure looks like it .i 'll admit the taste is slightly different , but i was n't impressed .again , while the serving of seafood was generous , to me , it was just cold , cooked crab , shrimp , and prawns .i 'm positive i can get as fresh a selection at any local seafood shop or even whole foods and recreate my own `` combination salad ; '' with higher quality lettuce to boot .overall , i was a bit disappointed .given the stellar reviews , i definitely expected more .perhaps i 'm spoiled .when i say fresh seafood , i mean rock cod that i just caught that morning or cooked prawns that i just bought live from the marina food market .heck , i 've even ate lobster sashimi where the lobster tentacles were still moving !that 's fresh !maybe in a location where people just eat microwaved dinners and canned goods , the food here would be amazing , but we live in the bay area !seafood is everywhere and live seafood is too .i enjoyed the ambiance , loved chatting with the other customers , but thought the food ( other than the oysters ) was average fare .sorry .by the way , be sure to bring your wallet .all that fresh seafood ai n't cheap .our bill came to ~ $ 65 and it 's cash only , all the time .",r9Wii37p0kEDIUt2e2_LqQ,San Francisco,7FmhdxWzroOdKuJx1PEeYA,NJo_OvJbglc8eSFkaAMR1A

''wtf , you do n't joke about that kinda shit and say it like you mean it , that 's just so immature .by the way , did i mention the piece of dirty shit on the glass of rim was `` obvious '' so that means that glass of water should n't have been brought out to begin with .3 .i asked for hot water to then only have the water boy tell me `` we do n't serve hot water here '' .are you kidding ?you do n't serve hot water ?what kind of restaurant is this ?ohhhh forgot to tell you , he was kidding after he walked away from our table and then came back to the table to tell us that a minute later .4 .the whole night , the waiter , the hosts , and the water boy threw the spoons , plates and water glasses on our table .do you know what `` service '' means ?do not know how to serve people ?part of coming out to eat at a restaurant is to be `` served !

4,lemonade-pasadena,"i 've been here over a dozen of times since they opened in my hood so i think i can accurately review most of their food now .the ordering process is a bit confusing but the workers here are extremely friendly and will gladly explain the steps to you if you ask and also do n't hesitate to ask for samples to taste before you order the food , you can even taste their lemonade .i 've tried pretty much all of their salads and here are my recommendations : orecchiette , tomato , perlini mozzarella , red pepper - i always get half portion of this salad , it 's light yet very tasty .the perlini mozzarella tastes so fresh .brussels sprouts , sherry , parmesan - the brussels sprouts taste amazing , they 're perfectly cooked and fresh w/ just a hint of bitterness balanced w/ the slight tartness of the sherry .watermelon radish , ahi tuna , snap peas , black sesame , ginger - i still ca n't figure out what type of watermelon they 're using in this salad .it 's not your typical watermelon , it tastes like sliced radish but w/ a green outer layer and a red center .the snap peas are nicely diced into the salad and the seared ahi tuna is pretty tasty .if the server is n't paying attention to what they 're scooping into your plate , you might not get any tuna , so make sure to look at your salad after they hand it to you .if you barely see any tuna you should ask for some .char siu chicken , swiss chard , pineapple , cashew - the char siu chicken tastes just like pork char siu , who knew that it would taste so good in a salad ?i 'm so used to eating bbq pork char siu w/ rice that i think this is a creative and refreshing way to present this ingredient in a dish .as for the land+sea section of their menu , i 've only tried the seared ahi tuna w/ orange ginger ponzu .it 's good but not worth an additional $ 6 , you only get about 5 thin slices and it brings your 1 portion salad 's price up from $ 4.50 to $ 10.50 .it 's not worth it in my opinion , i would pass on the land+sea section and just get a braise or soup .i also have n't tried any of their sandwiches , but for $ 9 a sandwich i think i rather walk down to corner bakery : p now onto my recommendations for braises and soups : chicken basque , artichoke , olive - i get this w/ a side of basmati rice , the chicken is very tender and flavorful .i love that it also has artichoke and olives , the braise is light yet extremely tasty .chicken chili - delicious , it does n't even taste like ground chicken , tastes more like beef .tastes great w/ a side of basmati rice or just toasted bread .their soup selection changes daily but my favorite are the tomato bisque , corn chowder , and cream of mushroom .as for dessert , definitely try a slice of their banana mascarpone cake , it 's super moist and creamy yet not too sweet .i would skip on their macarons and cookies , i 've tried both and was disappointed .the cookies taste dry and greasy and the macarons ( they 're huge ! )are dry and they do n't fill them with enough ganache .now saving the best for last , their lemonades are delicious !you must try it when you 're here .my favorites are their watermelon rosemary and blood orange .",EWJMLFFl9po0E8dRWuHOOA,Los Angeles,BTkldGfvBgciwxNwIaJj6w,q_qczJBqJLTlTbf7dPBFmw
1,gen-korean-bbq-house-west-covina,"the reviews here are either really good , or really , really bad .my experience here was horrible .i usually go to the gen in rowland heights but my family wanted to try the one near my work here in west covina .we arrived a little before 2 in the afternoon .right off the bat the service at the podium sucked .these ladies can stack on three layers of foundation but they ca n't tell you how long it 'll take to seat a party of five at a pretty empty restaurant , let alone hold a conversation .she was wearing glasses and was very dismissive .i could n't even tell if she jotted my name down for a table because she would n't make eye contact with me and kept turning her back to me .this would n't have bothered me as much if the place was packed , because i can empathize with employees trying to keep up with a lunch or dinner rush , but there were more people waiting for seats in the front than actual people seated and eating .also with previous experiences at the other gen location , they could be packed and i 'd still be greeted with a polite , competent host .not to mention that once she was finally able to tell me how long it would take ( after i and another member of my party had to ask repeatedly ) , we got to stand and watch as they seated people who came after us , and for sure it was n't a reservation issue because we were seated before a group who came in before us !when we finally got seated , we could n't tell who was our waiter because we had two separate people ask us for our drink and meat orders .the food came in slow , the drinks came in after our food .the waiters i feel a little more bad for than angry towards because it looked like they were understaffed in that department ( three hostesses but only three waiters ?who makes the schedule ? )and they actually seemed nice and were trying their best to be attentive , but i was n't too happy with the grill situation .we have two kids in our party , the waiter took our grill and left us sitting there with an open flame , but i think he just did n't think about it at that exact moment .for a group of five at an ayce restaurant , they were definitely skimping on the serving sizes , considering that the meat came out pretty slowly .i started work at four , my work is literally right across the street , we barely got our second round of meat before i had to leave for work .the service once we were seated i blame on poor training and scheduling on the manager 's part , the service at the front podium however was just annoying and inexcusable .",9Pw-Cq3G13KPECwO3cY__g,Los Angeles,ce0Rldi7OBzsmVTcA6MKyQ,t5WByWFFsdL74gY-aldBJw

2,doughnut-plant-new-york-4,"in a city that seems to live and breathe dunkin donuts ( for reference , i think we have two total in columbus ) i have to admit i was intrigued as to how a small shop in the les had gotten so much attention from foodies and i was even more interested by some of the flavors listed on their online menu .arriving at the small bakery ( smaller , even , than kossars ) the place was packed ( ie , 10 people ) so i stood outside and read the specials board for a moment .given the fact that my trek still contained a few more stops i decided i would order two donuts - a crème brulee and whatever was fresh from the oven .entering the doors i was greeted by a relatively strong yeasty-yet-sweet scent that mingled with strong coffee tones and was greeted , once again in a less than friendly manner , by a young lady behind the counter .seeing the crème brulee donuts were just being passed from the baking area to the front along with tres leches and a square donut entitled peanut butter and raspberry jelly .opting for the pb+j as my second option and paying the exorbitant cash-only fee of $ 7 for 2 donuts i sat down in the window to enjoy .starting with the crème brulee - small , yet heavy and dense and loaded with well caramelized vanilla custard i must admit the yeastiness of the donut managed to shine through the sweetness and although the custard was good it did suffer from a graininess that was somewhat unexpected .considering the focus on high quality ingredients and the overall pretentiousness of the shop i must admit that although good i was underwhelmed .moving on to the second donut i expected better - i love peanut butter and jelly , especially raspberry .lacking artificial flavors i fully anticipated a great peanut butter flavor from the donut , however what i got was anything but .apparently using a `` peanut butter glaze '' on the outside , the overall taste of the donut was actually `` burned peanuts '' - like the shell of a peanut at yankee stadium after you suck the salt off - while the inside featured a miniscule amount of fresh jam which , while good , was not even close to the level of the filling in keller 's bouchon beignets or the wonderful raspberry donut at payard .another disappointment in the les , i actually saw these donuts two more times during my travels ( at dean and delucca ) but opted not to taste any further flavors .perhaps i 'm more a cupcake guy , but if i 'm craving a donut in nyc i 'd rather spend 1/5 the price and get a pink donut from dunkin .",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,New York,Whi7ZUWUw9ZE6rNDMhauzw,nrOE20kYiLuXaXkzyiDWIA

5,layali-dubai-astoria,"hey , my name is figgy , and i had the pleasure of dining at layali dubai this past saturday night with my friend to watch my friend 's wife perform at the venue .we were both blown away !the food , the pageantry , the service were all top notch .middle eastern cuisine and culture at it 's finest at layali dubai .as a latino , with an indian friend that accompanied me this evening , we obviously do not speak the arabic language but it did not prevent us from enjoying the entertainment ; i am very in-tune with the culture as i have many middle eastern friends but the entire experience was very new to us and we loved every minute of it .the awesome hostess adeer took care of us providing us a tremendous table , the best waitress ever , and even calling me to confirm the reservation that afternoon .we arrived right before the belly dancing portion of the entertainment ( photo provided ) which was amazing .the performer is very beautiful , talented , charismatic , and she even performed a routine with flames which was very cool .now i am biased about one of the singers the very talented rana because her husband is one of my closest friends but she rocked the house as did the other singer that performed that night .the food was amazing !amazing !arguable the best middle eastern food i have ever had in new york city .we had the chicken kabobs with a seasoned rice and a thin crust pita bread that was seasoned with a pesto oil .everything was delicious !the chicken was perfectly seasoned , the rice was amazing , the pita was the hit of the night .the soups ( spinach and chicken/pasta ) they provided before the meal which were included with the meal were delicious .what an amazing night and friendly atmosphere from everyone from the staff to the patrons .the owner of the establishment does an excellent job providing a quality experience .as perfect as the experience as it was for me , i have seen a couple of people online complain about problems with reservations , wait times , no drinks , the entertainment charge , etc .in my experience , and i look for things to put in my reviews , i did not notice any issues , and the place was packed on saturday night so ignore those criticisms .regarding the drinks , the place is dry , no drinks .as i understand it , there is a mosque across the street , and the establishment is respectful of the islamic faith which i give them credit for doing because it adds nicely to the atmosphere that there is no booze .my one criticism , small one , i will admit that i am not a fan of the $ 10 or $ 20 entertainment charge because i am used to places eating the cost of entertainment but many places like club aladdin in new jersey for example charge the same fee so i guess that is a staple of the business model for middle eastern lounges .i will say that once you get over the charge that everything else is quality for the money charged especially the food which is worth every single penny .i highly recommend this spot and i encourage everyone to check it out .as-salamu alaykum : )",i4ELZx8-AeM2-WPNWU5VGw,New York,67SK84B23cs2zOXy_IdjGw,lc6KovwpQZqyUdikDZ_LFw

1,jollibee-los-angeles,"so after getting a message from yelp hq that my original review was removed because it did not adhere to content guidelines and/or because fanboys of jollibee probably flagged my review , i decided to edit my review and repost .when i originally posted my negative experiences , some people told me that i had to try the chicken and not their burgers .so when i went back today to write this review i ordered the 2 for $ 3 crunchy chicken bites because i did not want to waste too much money here .the crunchy chicken bites consisted of two pieces of fried chicken sandwiched between lettuce , globs of mayo and a mushy pan de sall roll .to be fair the chicken was actually pretty moist and tender .however , it lacked any seasoning so i had to ask for some ketchup to add to the sandwich to save it from epic blandness .the weakest part of the crunchy chicken bite was the mushy bread .so i ended up just eating the chicken .so at the end of the day , i still think jollibee does not taste great and their weird ronald mcdonald knock-off mascot that 's supposed to be a bee still looks uncannily pervy to me .good thing the statue has since been removed .crunchy chicken bite : bit.ly/16zupbz -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- edited original review to comply with yelp content guidelines sans f-bombs : since , this location is less than a mile from my office , my coworker and i stopped by and ordered the big yum and the aloha burger combos , which were not cheap .sadly , the burgers tasted so processed and microwaved that the meat was like leather and had a fishy scent to it ( probably since they sell a lot of fish products ) .in the end , both of us tossed are food away and went somewhere else .you would have thought that this would deter me from a return visit ?well , i always try a place twice ( as for today it is now three times ) before hating on it .so i ordered the spam bites , 5-piece shanghai roll ( lumpia aka egg roll ) , and the famous peach mango pies because i just was not feeling banana ketchup flavored spaghetti .the spam bite was literally spam with mayo on a pan de sal roll .nothing special .the egg roll filled with ground pork or some other mystery meat felt like it was deep-fried hours in advance and pretty much tasteless .as for the peach mango pie , it tasted factory-made .you remember those pastries they used to sell in vending machines ?well these pies tasted worse .the peach mango filling was so sweet it would probably make willy wonka give up sugar .i guess if i wanted a real filipino pie i should have just gone to a filipino bakery .maybe it 's just me , but for a place that is supposed to be selling pinoy food i was amazed they did not have adobo , pancit/noodles , or a decent pork dish .",j1981ubRRPjeRTx9UkMJ5g,Los Angeles,ZkWvKM6ee3Iqb1bysTomVQ,UuzeFGD5UMtg92S4fExX4Q

''there was n't much that was cucina povera ( poverty ) about the prices here .1 ) farinata : a pizza shaped flat bread made of chickpea flour .boringly bland , dry texture .i had socca , another name for farinata , in the town of nice , france which was once part of italy & recall it was more flavourful eating it at a sidewalk café .2 ) polpo : charred octopus tentacle .smoky , soft , sweet , fibrously meaty w/ non-descript sunchoke puree , watercress & frisee dressed w/ light vinaigrette to brighten the bitter greens for a good counterpoint to the octopus .3 ) culatello : originally from pianura padana , plain of the po river is dark rose red cured pork salame w/ only a bit of veining of white fat is moist , stretchy w/ a meaty , slightly acetic acid , fermented , earthy scent .baguette is no big deal , but the butter has a sweet , scented grassy dairy fragrance .4 ) lingua salmistrata : tongue here is a thing of beauty , finely veined w/ a white , rich fat that melts-in-mouth & dusty rose tinted meat that is ever so tender .there is a spam-like fatty meaty odor w/ traces of possibly sage , black pepper , garlic , black peppercorns , thyme , bay leaves , cloves for almost pastrami flavor .chopped taggia olives for a briny , earthiness & ruccola for a peppery , peanut oil scented bitterness .5 ) gnocchi : small tiny pillows are soft , starchy , crème of wheat-like yet maintains its membranous skin , coated w/ a sweet , buttery castelmagno/half cream cow 's milk cheese fonduta .6 ) bassa padana : al dente risotto made from arborio rice , cut slices of rough ground , porky luganega & cotechino sausage for a farmer john breakfast sausage flavor .grana padano , relative to parmigiano reggiano cheese adds a milky , creamy , lactic acid tone w/ drizzling of aged aceto balsamico .7 ) pesce : vialone nano veronese ( indicazione geografica protetta ) is very fat , mouth filling al dente rice grain .creamy w/ a mélange of chopped langoustine , smoked eel , black mussels & clams in its shell in a frutti di mare sauce veloute .8 ) milanese : bright yellow , orange risotto of vialone nano veronese , touched w/ herbal , just opened oyster minerality scent of saffron & cheesy dairy creaminess .sitting in the middle , a piece of roasted bone-in marrow .9 ) foiade bergamasche : wide , pappardelle style , chestnut pasta was bit over-cooked for a softer mushier feel dressed w/ a rich , meaty duck sugo/demi-glace sauce .10 ) nastrini del miracolo : ancient grain texture is dry & rough .butcher table 's ragu is a bit watery & gamy , hint of oregano .11 ) stinchetto di maiale : roasted pork shank in a sea of yellow corn polenta/grits , bit of greens to relieve the carbs & meaty protein .12 ) rustin nega : lombata di vitello/veal chop was grilled grass fed baby beef grilled over wood fire so part of the meat was cooked well to leave a chaw .inner pink medium rare meat was soft , silky , meaty .beefiness is subtle , divine .cipollini onions were caramelized , but cured pork over-cooked , over salted were leathery , unpleasantly chewy .semi-caramelized demi-glace sauce added meatier umami .this was the crowning dish .2-10a ) raphael , our congenial , conscientious waiter , suggested a spanish tempranillo to pair especially w/ the rustin nega , but i wanted italian wine that would be regionally more congruent .he suggested a dolcetto d'alba from piedmonte , but said it would not be a perfect fit .dolcetto had faint blueberry , blackberry scent along w/ a juicy , plum flavor .but it was too sour , earthy , acidic , astringent , grainy & over-powered the subtle lombata di vitello .my 'bad ' .11 ) torrone : frozen nougat-like semi-freddo w/ a taste of citron/candied citrus .when frozen , texture is drier , but as it melts , becomes creamier .chocolate swirls on the plate & 2 conserved tiny cherry-like fruits preserved in perhaps cherry liqueur .various paste at brera do n't seem to match the high quality of its sister ristorante , factory kitchen .it does n't have the fresh , stretchy , snappy yet chewy mouthfeel .most of the dishes here are competently done , but i do n't sense a wow factor in general .3+ yelp stars .",o0exBsBaHnS4O9SHjwwpOQ,Los Angeles,ziq8xLjx7sZsgyWp22xS8g,DGWbpHZ0NhkH75y3_fq1tA

1,moonshine-152-boston,"i think me feeling like going home halfway through the meal to make a sammich or eat some home food is saying something about this place .i actually tried justifying that it was just what we ordered that did n't go well together .but if you have a restaurant that has 4-5 stars on yelp that should n't be a problem , all your dishes should taste good .i do have to say that we did buy the groupon for 45 .the local mixed greens salad i thought was okay with crispy kale and some oily dressing , which would have done much nicer with some honey mustard/sweet balsamic drizzled on top .the onion soup was probably the star of the meal which is weird , but it had truffle oil and was really impressively nice when you dipped the fried mozarella sticks in !for entrees we ordered the crispy flounder filet ( with uni shrimp sauce ) and the easter rabbit special .the crispy flounder filet was actually okay , but the sauce was way too overpowering .it also came with fried lotus and a fried something else that tasted carby and floury .the shrimp was something you buy from the supermarket and not very fresh .the easter rabbit special was something we thought we 'd try , but it also was n't very good .came in a bowl of mush and had something like a mashed potato underneath it .sounds horrible does n't it .to top it off it had cheese and was just a gooey bowl of stuff with meat in it .i ca n't believe this was one of groupon 's bestsellers , and that yelp gave it 5 stars at the time i bought it ( both reasons i bought the groupon ) .dessert we had the upside down pineapple cake which was pretty good !so overall i would say the try items the onion soup and pineapple cake , but the main entrees of the meal were a huge disappointment .for the groupon i do have to note they did charge like $ 4 tax , which is fine but was n't really mentioned on the deal .for anyone who did n't buy the groupon , it would have ended to be $ 70- $ 80 meal which would totally not be worth it .sorry moonshine , i do n't think i would be recommending you guys or coming back anytime soon again .also.p.s .i do n't know how you guys have so many good reviews .but hopefully yelp is n't taking advantage of bribery or your friends should be more honest .sorry , just had to say it .",V9PYMYF-lr8GRqWH1O43yQ,Boston,zrGnbFo1k7HXqmHBgmPCtA,CaUgYatpt1i-mKZVZQdhbg
2,buffalo-wild-wings-burbank,ehhh.it was our first time here for all 3 diners and we thought we would be off to a good meal with a super friendly waiter .service was great in the beginning and then completely fell off the radar once our order was in .food was nothing exciting .asked for wings extra crispy and they were still that gooeyness of wing skin which is gross to me .i was excited about all the sauce choices but the ones we tried were nothing special .we got a couple wraps as well and they were just average .all in all a pretty bland blah meal .,0wYuREI8lQncPuDw5ztWIA,Los Angeles,OPuWbbumU_tUeah5CF_CTA,UjC6z-ymmuU1Jeflf1Y3oQ
3,kato-los-angeles,"the chef is very talented in plating and creative with the flavors .i enjoyed the flavors of every dish and my favorites were the smoked hamachi with charred scallions and corn potage .however , the restaurant fell short on everything else .1 ) lack in comfort : the seats were very uncomfortable .considering the average dining time here is about 1.5 hours , they should have provided more comfortable seating .2 ) lack in food portion : the portions were typical of 10 plus course tastings but since it 's only a 5 course tasting , the portions should have been slightly larger , even if just a tablespoon more .3 ) lack in value : we did n't feel full even after ordering the pork belly rice .it just did n't feel right to still feel hungry after a meal that averaged about $ 75/pp , after tax and tip .4 ) lack of uni : one of the dishes we had was called uni porridge but had crab too - not only was the uni not visible , the unmistakable taste of uni was also mia .the diners at the table next to us expressed the same disappointment !however , the crab in the porridge was visible and tasty .the porridge was a comforting dish .why not just call it seafood porridge instead ?5 ) lack of consideration for utensil placement : you get a spoon , chopsticks and fork wrapped in napkin .you are expected to reuse your utensils for each dish but there is nothing to place your used and to be reused utensils .they should provide something for the utensils to be place between it and the table top .6 ) parking : this plaza seems to always be packed .however , the street meter parking spots ( 2-3 spots ) are usually available .summary : 5 stars for flavor , 3.5 stars for service and 1 star for everything else .tips : 1 ) if you must try this place , be sure to eat a snack before coming .2 ) the only sign for this restaurant is on their door which is hard to see from the inside of your car .just know it 's in the same plaza as tokyo fast food and it 's one restaurant to the left , near the staircase .",aG6Q_IKp5qLu0uV7LHaR_A,Los Angeles,icji_m3EhpftlP5lF4O2aA,1n4L0B3pLw0VMwAorSjrog

1,road-to-seoul-los-angeles,"i have heard of a lot of good things about this location before i came here , enough that i wanted to check this place out for myself to give things a try .after all , an all you can eat kbbq place for under $ 20 seemed like a pretty good deal initially .but after my first visit , i was left entirely unimpressed by this restaurant , and i think they have some improvements to be made before i would want to return .food : the menu had a lot of items you are able to choose from , but the first few rounds for my party and me consisted of sampling different meat options because we were unfamiliar with what was good and what was not .i think that at the end of the night we agreed that the best options form the entire menu were the marinated beef short ribs and possibly the bulgogi .they were the meat options that had the most flavor .other choices like the `` road to seoul beef '' and the brisket were rather bland to the taste .you had to use the dipping sauces for them in order to get any taste from it at all .other dishes , like the rice cake wrapped in pork sound good in theory , but was also tasteless unless you dip it in oil or another sauce .i feel that these meat options need to have their own stand along flavor without any sauce .by the time we got to our table at the start of our meal , there were already side dishes there for us .this included a salad as well as other pickled vegetables .i was very underwhelmed by the fact that the kimchi side they gave us consisted of only one piece of lettuce .i know that we could have asked for more , but i wished that they had supplied more to begin with .there was also no rice served with our meal until much later.we had thought that since it was never given to us that we had to pay extra for it .it turns out that they were just really late in serving it , as we did n't get any until later on in the meal .the rice was also too soft in my opinion , and i think a little overly cooked .the meal also came with a hot pot tofu dish , which was decent but not great , and an egg dish also served in the hot pot .i felt like both cooled down too quickly , and by the time i got to it , the pots were already losing heat .overall , food was not very good and underwhelming.i had expected more , especially in terms of quality and taste .service : this is a self-service place in terms of food cooking.no one will really help you to come around and cook the meat , so you are on your own .other kbbq places in the area have people there to help you cook the food to make sure that it 's prepared correctly .although the people helping us seemed friendly , the actual execution of the service was not very good .when we ordered our first round of meat , we later found out that they had given us the wrong items.sure it was all you can eat , but more it was more unwanted meat that we had to go through .they never asked to see if this was our first time there , so we were very confused by the meat that they gave to us .it was tricky at times because there would be not enough staff members to track down to answer our questions , especially to ask about what meat they actually gave to us .there is also a button at the table you can press to ask for your server , but it still took them a while to get to us .the only time we used it was actually to ask for rice , but right when we asked for it , someone came to give it to us maybe 30 minutes through our meal .i feel as though rice is a dish that needs to come out in the beginning .this service issue would also be remedied if things ran more efficiently in my opinion .i think they also need to change grill pans more frequently , without us having to ask for them all the time .it would have made our meal go by a lot faster if this were the case .also , plates were not changed until we had to ask for them , which also slowed down our meal .atmosphere : the actual place was kind of a turn off for me too.it kind of has a sticky and greasy feel about it , and not very conducive to what i would consider a nice eating environment .when we sat down , the table we had was still wet from the wipe down i 'm assuming , so things like the menu were damp from it .i do not think that the ventilation was working very well when we went either , and we even had to ask the server if things were working at our table .i remember feeling very dizzy at one point , probably from all the smoke smell that resulted from the cooking .i had to step outside for a moment to get rid of the nausea .it came back when i sat down though , and i think it was because the vent of the table next to me was not working so all their smoke was blowing at me .it was very disappointing , and definitely did not allow me to enjoy my meal

''was even more shocking .the sushi here is n't bad , but it 's more along the lines of a fast food-type quality and the small nigiri explains their ability to offer cheap happy hour-type pricing .so if you come for the happy hour menu alone , or you do n't require a high quality of fish , you may not have the shocking experience that i did .but if you compare your sushi to the likes of sasabune or hiko , do yourself a favor and skip this place .",SIZOfo7jTjCXnL8ZtpM2aw,Los Angeles,0TycLO8lFJ4n9OZMiulg8w,zsrOavISa7g7GWQfVXIMyg

2,the-butcher-the-baker-the-cappuccino-maker-west-hollywood-2,"saturday // 22 july 2017 came here for a dinela dinner .food was alright , and perhaps not worth it 's price point .the ambiance & service , however , along with the drink selection may change your mind , however it would be hard for me to come back .-- -food -- - the `` food '' category headlines many of my reviews because taste is at the top of my value set .these are restaurant reviews after all , and i 'm not one to necessarily come for the ambiance .succinctly , the appetizers set high expectations , to which the main course disappointed , and the dessert - further so .if you aim to come here for some light snacking and a drink or two with a friend , it would pass as a stellar place .however , the main courses were slightly above-average , at best .the desserts should be ignored altogether .for appetizers , we ordered the summer corn soup , mushroom tempura & the foccacia herb mascarpone .all were fantastic .the tempura was n't too oily , with the mascarpone providing a nice contrast to the full-bodied soup .the flat iron steak ordered was dry ( though , it could 've been our fault ordering it at a medium-well , shame us if you will ) & the seared salmon fillet was n't particularly spectacular or noteworthy .the desserts were the most disappointing .having felt like they were taken out of refrigeration , the brownie was very tough & dry .the tres leches was a bit sweet .though the rice pudding with mango & coconut was balanced and enjoyable !detailed thoughts & explanations will be included in each of the photos of the dishes , if you 'd like to read more .overall , i 'd be hard pressed to recommend this place on the basis of food alone .-- -price , value , & portion size -- - very quickly , the question almost always following `` was it good '' is `` was it worth it '' ?in this case , it was not .again , the appetizers raised our spirits , and our expectations for what to expect for the main course .i found those portion sizes hugely satisfying and able to be shared by a group of 3-5 .i 'm reserved to let this review sound like `` come here for the appetizers '' , but they are very good , and worth the money .after that , the food-to-cost ratio went downhill .the main courses were slightly more filling , but perhaps not as satisfying .and again , skip the desserts altogether .( to give the benefit of the doubt , perhaps pastries are their specialty and what we should 've tried . )-- -ambiance -- - if there are any redeeming factors , they 're in this & the next category .the interior and exterior seating arrangements are gorgeous .there is attention paid to every detail .there is uniformity and an air of consistence with the quaint & chic style they 're going for .there is a huge amount of passion behind all the work put forth - and it 's on display .coffee bean burlap sacks are splayed by their roaster .marble tables provide great backdrops for social media .outside , there is a great view of sunset blvd .& lots of greenery and comfortable seating .the décor is impressive , and if i were to take someone who valued that aspect immensely , then this might just be the place for them .-- -service -- - service was absolutely phenomenal .the general manager , i believe his name was devin , checked up on us multiple times & asked us how we were doing , told stories of bbcm café 's opening and his move here from nyc , told us about his coffee `` snobbery '' ( in a good way ) , and generally kept an upbeat vibe .he made sure to keep our glasses full , and told us that we were sitting in a supposedly highly demanded `` instagrammable '' table .despite the achingly slow turnaround between ordering & the food arriving ( something unexpected from a manager who is from a fast-paced city like new york ) , we were well taken care of by all the very hospitable staff at bbcm café !-- -logistics -- - parking on sunset blvd. , may be a pain .however , there should be a back lot .when we came in for a 7:30p saturday dinner , it was surprisingly slow .however , it began to pick up by the time we started eating .i 'd say it 'd be wise to make a reservation - just in case !-- -final thoughts -- - would i come back ?probably not .i do n't think i 'd choose to willingly come back here anytime soon .however , i would be more open in a different context : perhaps during brunch , or for a quick bite .i have n't written this place off completely , and would give the benefit of the doubt to the possibility that we did n't pick dishes we particularly liked .however , with the vast level of restaurant selections in los angeles , i anticipate it 'd be a while before that happened .",JxR_YuOVnLPNJRfUx_QaCg,Los Angeles,lj3tB5_oqLtNqpl-aCCzUQ,rPX32KdJT32WFmXzNpPjRA
1,peak-thai-restaurant-new-york,"ok food .horrible experience .my friends actually made me lower the rating because they 're a lot angrier than i am .they want to give them 0 stars .just beware for all those who come here .stick to what you know .my friend tried the pad thai and said it smelled like dog food .also , he wanted to add that the entire restaurant smelled like dog food .i would n't know but i had to trade plates with him because he looked so uncomfortable .okay .i was about to give this place a four star review because i actually liked the food .it was great !i would 've been a repeat customer had it not been for the horrid service .i understand your restaurant is busy during lunch .i get it .but i 've been to plenty of busy restaurants that can still handle the customers .i also hate to point out names on reviews , especially bad ones so i wo n't drop names .but the waitress wore red toms while i was here .her behavior toward me and my friends was what made me turn this review from great to bad .it started out ok. we asked for separate checks and she said to let them know in the beginning so that they could handle that before we ordered .that 's fine and we apologized for it .turns out the orders were all the same price so she put them on one receipt and we put three cards down .standard .we do it all the time .then she takes the cards and says `` do any of you have cash ? ''to which we answer no , sorry we do n't have cash .then she lets out this really audible `` ugh ! ''and walks away angrily .woah , i 'm sorry if you have a cash policy here .at least post more signs because not everyone sits near the front ( not even sure if there 's a sign there but there better be or else she 's just an angry waitress ) .service really makes or breaks it for me for any restaurant .you can have amazing food but if you do n't have the service to match it , it ruins the whole experience .not to mention that my friends also had a hard time understanding the menu so we asked a male waiter to explain it .without saying a word , he rolled his eyes and grabbed a more `` detailed '' menu and slapped it down on the table and quickly flipped through the pages and read the titles `` entree , curry , etc '' .we could 've read that ourselves and they were still confused because the menu did n't help much .",qn2pHkA6HMkFrG97KOzHbw,New York,_GEidTbG5oy228FJvHfdlQ,pnDY-ucS5jTmiTNCVTwA9w

3,the-donut-pub-new-york,"another day and another donut would take me to a venerable 1964 institution that had for one reason or another always fallen outside my dining agendas , buzzy geduld 's 24/7 donut pub on 14th .with a somewhat obscure gameplan for the day including a midnight dinner at minetta tavern prior to making my way to laguardia for a 6:05am flight home the next morning it was n't so much that i 'd planned to visit donut pub , but more that it was there , i was on my way to a movie , and while looking in the window i saw the staff loading the shelves with hot and fresh donuts .obviously not expecting the artisan pastries of dough or donut plant considering the oldschool environs and low prices i made my way into the shop just after ten pm to find the space approximately half full and greeted by a server who simply asked `` what can i getcha '' i quickly assessed the situation and asking him what he recommended he stated `` well , you got ta try the red velvet and the fritters just came out of the fryer '' - the same two options i would have ordered , though i have to say the vanilla kreme and oft raved black and white cookie had also caught my eye .taking my order - inclusive of a rather unmemorable coffee that never seemed to dip below 2/3 full thanks to the helpful servers - i sat at the bar to enjoy my selections and beginning first with the warm fritter i was admittedly a bit underwhelmed because although the exterior was crunchy and nicely glazed with a dense interior full of cinnamon and pie filling the sweetness was just too cloying - something i rarely complain of given my substantial sweet tooth , but something that i tend to notice when confronted with high fructose corn syrup in large quantity .faring better than the fitter , the red velvet selection was an old fashioned cake donut with hefty notes of cocoa and a dense crumb beneath a light compliment of glaze that added just a touch of sweetness - basically just a good chocolate old fashioned with red dye from an old fashioned sort of place , the sort of place you can find all over america.but not always churning out fresh product 24 hours a day and 7 days a week for nearly 50 years .",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,New York,RzLnswyHLzBRbuz8wamNew,HohIm5tLTfjKccyS7f96Yg

''just 3 words would remove a lot of confusion .our bus boy was the one the most friendly : smile , courteous and actually helpful .he asked us if we needed another grill , got our waiter for us when we did n't realize there was a bell service .even the kid who hauled out the ice cream as we were leaving were nicer to us than sara , our main waitress and server .that 's a bad management issue , as far as i can see because that 's bad training there .maybe she 's got something on the manager ?= ) but honestly , when everyone else but the actual person who is suppose to be serving you is pretty good , something is off and they need to fix that .i 'd definitely go back again .but this is not a place for sushi , nor a huge variety of different meats in marinades if that 's what you 're looking for .wear your shirts and jeans but it 's a little more upscale than that .everyone else looked better than your average t-shirt and jeans crowd , so if you do n't want to feel out of place .= )",NLCaCHNVMmQPakXpWIF_sQ,Los Angeles,cyTVYwkAbFIfBoYcj1TKWw,IkVN9Ob8mptWR5j8LCcuMQ

1,premium-sweets-and-restaurant-jackson-heights,"being born in bangladesh , i have high expectations when it comes to bd food .ps & r falls short.way short .i came here with the my wife who like me , will eat anything .we hardly come to the jh area but since we were there , we decided to give these guys a try .it was ramadan , so i guess they had more food than usual - funny how that works !besides having a regular hot bar they had another open buffet style table with iftaar food + a bunch of kebabs and biryani dishes .the food on this buffet table had no cover and who knows how long it had just been sitting out there gathering dust .however , it was n't an actual buffet .you had to order the food by plate .the whole thing was a bit haphazard and chaotic which made me feel i was back in bd .as my luck would have it , they did n't have kachchi biryani so i decided to go with the goat biryani instead .i also saw a few things that i liked so we went all out and tried a bunch of other stuff : goat biryani : not bad but poor meat to rice ratio .i was done with the meat with half the rice still on my plate .3/5 golda chingri ( large prawn in curry ) : the curry was n't bad but the prawn was overcooked and rubbery .either that or it was n't fresh .at $ 15 per prawn , this was a rip off .good thing i only got one .2/5 jhura gosh : my mom makes this dish really well .it 's normally made with beef that 's partially shredded and has very little sauce but a lot of flavor .theirs had mostly fatty pieces and quite a bit of oil , but tasted okay .2.5/5 aloo bhaji : sliced potatoes lightly fried in oil & spices .this is probably one of the easiest dishes to make in bd cuisine .they did an okay job but made me appreciate how much better the aloo bhaji was at home when i was growing up .3.5/5 after trying these dishes , we were still hungry as the portions were small .so i went back up to the hot food bar and ordered two more meat dishes .chicken tandoor : this is an indian dish and not a traditional bd dish but i thought i would try theirs anyway .it tasted like card board .a very strong candidate for the worst chicken tandoor i 've ever tasted .1/5 bihari kebab : this is n't a traditional bd dish either but it 's popular in bd and served in many restaurants .the flavor was okay but the beef had the texture of mashed potatoes .it was inedible .1/5 after the meal , i had the unfortunate experience of having to use one of their restrooms .it literally smelled like shit .the meal was about $ 55 with tips ( thankfully no tax was added ) .for a bd meal , that 's a ridiculous amount of money to be spending for two people .we had to order a lot of food to make up for the small portions and almost none of it was good .i felt i paid a premium to have a low quality meal so i guess you could say premium lived up to its name !",33h9Jv4VKbbxB42CUD9WQg,New York,IRDUSt1oojcyINXvSmt7eg,FAJKYn4YjhEotwegIBFweA

3,sushistop-los-angeles,"so this new sushi place on sawtelle finally opened .and i checked it out for a quick bite .i 've been eyeing this establishment for weeks prior to opening as somewhat dubious and *ahem* derivative looking logo was mounted in a new business complex on sawtelle blvd .well it finally opened today and i was intrigued by the 'all items are $ 2.50 ! ''and decided to take the challenge .this is a cozy little place , where all the seating is at the counter , no tables .it reminds me of the neighborhood sushi joints i saw in tokyo where people just wanted to sit down after a long tiring day at work and enjoy a little raw fish .there is that atmosphere that is condusive to small groups or single diners .the menu is pretty simple and it 's true , all items are only $ 2.50 , include orders of nigiri sushi ( 2 pieces ) hand rolls ( 1 piece ) and other rolls ( 8 pieces ) .the fish selection itself is nothing more than you would expect in this price range ( maguro , yellowtail , salmon , mackerel , etc ) .no uni or toro to be found here , no sir .all the rolls are familiar and typical for what you 'd find in the typical food court type sushi stall .they offer several hot items as well include curry and udon bowls , again all $ 2.50 .in addition to the regular menu , they offer several special items as well , in addition to the tuna , yellowtail and chicken curry bowl i ordered i decided on the seared salmon belly which was surprisingly good as they topped it with caviar and it did n't require any seasoning at all .hardcore sushi enthusiasts and snobs , this is most definitely not the place for you , but for a mere $ 13 i was able to have a filling and frankly , large dinner , all freshly made by sushi chefs right in front of you .if they manage to keep up this pricing scheme , this place can potentially do well , with many neighborhood and university student diners nearby .i 'm quite curious to see how it does in the coming months .",C9WHeAxjoR9Nxo7l-Y-F0g,Los Angeles,hg1iEBUFKO1eBO_zHh4Cjg,QiOgPlHpgXLyG1qFVmmIDg

''he started to swear as if i have done something wrong .and with that , i got up left the restaurant .needless to say we were the only customers in the restaurant .this owner is very short tempered and aggressive to the customers .there are plenty of other good sushi restaurant riddled in ventura blvd .avoid the fish house at all cost .this place does n't deserve business .",PlHPZyaPasHPFLbS08tZmA,Los Angeles,kc69p-TzuoHttAuTggRtJg,a-7GNJPkCC2HVsZzyEXzRA

2,by-chloe-new-york-11,"decide to try something new in 2016 , writing reviews here .the hype of by chloe has been particularly strong lately in the city , so i decide to give it a try though i 'm not a vegan .i arrived at 5pm and jumped into the line starting by the door , it took like 10 mins till i made my order in the counter and 10 mins for the foods , then the chaos just started .it was unfortunate for me to get my foods before it took me 10 mins to secure a seat , while a lot of people were reserving seats long before their foods actually came .i do n't blame people of being selfish to reserve the seats but it 's horrible to see people holding their trays and trying to fight for seats , against people whose companions were still waiting in line to make orders .what frustrated me is that the management seems just do n't care !on same situation , mighty quinn 's bbq handles it quite well , by having an employee to arrange seats for customers with foods on hands during busy hours , people without foods on hands are not allowed to reserve seats .i understand this might not work for the condition of by chloe , but at least do something please !now for the foods , i ordered the classic burger ( $ 8.95 ) and air baked sweet potato fries ( $ 3.95 ) .as a non-vegan , the lentil patty in classic burger is better than i expected but the combination of ingredients , pickles , onion and sauces , overall is just mediocre .the air baked sweet potato fries is just normal , i agree that it 's not as greasy as the regular oil-fried fries , but the downside of this healthier method is that it became soggy and soft ( turns cold ) when i finally started eating .also , those fries in smaller size or thin edge are easy to get burnt .( to be fair , it was still crispy in the meantime when i was waiting for next available seat ) i am skeptical about how people claim this vegan as a healthy choice .without any doubt , their vegetables ingredients are healthy right before they cooked it , but the ways of how they flavor the foods give rise to my concern .the fries was very salty , the beet ketchup tastes like a very sweet onion sauce without any beet taste but only the bloody color , the chipotle aioli should be less spicy for dipping fries .my tongue felt very dry for an hour right after i left , no matter how much water i drank , it made me worried about the intake of sodium from the meal .considering the cost of veggie patty would be much less than beef patty or fried chicken , i do n't think i got a commensurate value here .( they 're also selling a whole coconut ( $ 5.00 ) with by chloe logo on it , such a ripoff !i 'm sure that it is an unreasonable markup for a non-full service restaurant since it only costs $ 1.5 in chinatown retail .i travel to south asia alot , stroll in many asian supermarkets in states and understand the prices of different coconuts so do n't try to hype it up . )this operation struck me as superficial and overrated , i guess the marketing ( cute logos , decor ) somehow brings up the hype and fuss , especially for women customers .i 'm contemplated to give 3 stars but i just feel it is lack of commitment to the principles of bringing customers healthy meals .",M6eWWsXbx1zjCSuqWMng9w,New York,7SDZozF5q46hq1XLoEj9aQ,m5Mi5PVCLeYBbNwREOit4w

2,the-melting-pot-irvine,"came here for irvine restaurant week since my boyfriend and i always heard about it but never went to a fondue place .we were expecting to dip our appetizer and main course in cheese but was n't like that at all .it was a maze in there , and the time in between each course took forever , and we had no idea where our server was 80 % of the time .for 40 a person , it came with a glass of wine , salad , the cheese course , main course and dessert .the cheese course : we could only choose one type of cheese since our table had only one burner , so we both chose the traditional swiss cheese .the white wine overpowered the cheese and left a bitter taste at the end of each bite .the good thing was that you could ask for more bread and veggies if you wanted .for the main course , we chose bourguignonne style cooking for our filet mignon , lobster , shrimp , herbed chicken , and some vegetables .they provided a tempura batter and sesame batter as well .we realized it was so heavy and oily , and the oil temp continued to increase so eventually our oil turned dark , as well as our food .the batter would brown so quickly but the inside would n't cook through .we had to change it to court bouillon instead .dessert we had he cookies and cream , marshmallow dream .that was delicious and a great presentation when it was flambéd tableside .overall ?this was different and probably the reason why it 's so pricey , since not many restaurants have fondue style .but to be honest , it is n't worth all the work and hassle you put it in to cook food , food that is n't all that special .",v2yN8ZNW3fMC_xZP9CkZLQ,Los Angeles,2-qCpJMrm2EPdwVzrAEI2Q,x2Scg6yk2qOWI2tvTCwYTw

2,t-neer-sierra-madre-2,"i 've enjoyed afternoon teas before , and was stoked to find this place thru groupon , and treated my mom to this , especially since it was her first time doing `` yum cha '' english style .however , after today , this place sadly , was not our `` cup of tea '' .i bought from groupon : $ 25 for afternoon tea for two ( $ 39 value ) , which includes the following per every two people : tea , three half sandwiches , two mini scones , two bowls of soup , and two desserts .even though the promo expired on mines , the only thing that we did n't get was the soup , and it would have cost us $ 7 .i was confused at first since our promo was $ 39 value , and the menu set in front of us was $ 32 value , and so i did n't understand why i had to pay an extra $ 7 since this was the original promo they had and what i bought .so , the daughter , who was waiting our table , brought over her mom the manager , aka momager to explain the value , and in the end , she charged us $ 5 for the soup .i was fine with it , until we saw the soup bowl size.for $ 5 , the soup bowl size was hella small - about half the size of a rice bowl , and my mom was pissed , and considered that wallet rape .she was miffed that the lentil soup , especially since lentils are cheap , you can make a large quantities of it .that ruined the moment for my mom the most .as for the rest of the food and drinks : teas : i got the # 65 .coconut chai- iced - it was delicious .it was the right amount of sweet for the chai , and it smelled wonderful .i would definitely recommend getting this one .my mom also liked this one .for my mom , i chose # 120 .whimsical adventure - since it had a fruity taste to it because she was worried about not being able to sleep if i chose her something too strong/bitter tasting .mom did n't like this one in the beginning until she sweetened it with splenda and it tasted better .it was an alright tea to me .the only thing i do n't like with the two teas we ordered : no refills since these two teas were brewed first ( whimsical adventure ) , and that it is milk-based ( coconut chai ) .if we ended up choosing teas with leaves , then refills are okay .food : sandwiches : cucumber with cream cheese and dill ; tomato/spinach ; and pineapple chicken .of the three , we both liked the pineapple chicken the best .it was light , refreshing and a good source of protein .the only thing mom did n't like with the sandwiches was that the bread was a lil too dry .as for the scones - we both liked those .it was a blueberry and vanilla scones with fresh cream and strawberry jam .it was soft and moist .lastly , the desserts sucked : the egg pudding was boring - was hoping for a slice of the yummy cake that other yelpers posted , and the chopped up cantaloupe and strawberries were n't great either .the strawberry was okay , but the cantaloupe was chopped too close to the rind , and it kept poking my mom in the throat , and i just ate the strawberries .service : the service was alright .despite the confused beginning , i was willing to forego it .however , at the end , the momager was cold .she slipped by with the check without so much as a thank you or anything , and warmly greeted this lady with her two young kids , who came in .for me , that was enough to not want to come back anymore .sadly , i was hoping to make my mom 's first yum cha experience a fun one , but after venturing here , not worth the second comeback .",JN9u_i6GUzp6SbafK8XI-Q,Los Angeles,qbn12k2Bp_g7LRUmsNxPVw,HUhtsDj6lvWr_G6iWl9fPw

4,bottega-louie-los-angeles,"we rolled into town from vegas , and this was our first stop .i 've read about bottega louie through echo & rig reviews in vegas ( same company ) and after a four hour drive , we were ready to grub .beautiful white , marble and gold interior with an open kitchen to see the action , but the high ceilings make this place much louder than it is .this place can get noisy !service was great , and food came in a timely manner with no mix ups at all .we chose to share everything family style just to get a little nibble because this was n't the only food stop planned for the day .we ordered the crab beignets , duck prosciutto crostini , lamb shank and risotto , lobster bisque , butter lettuce and goat cheese salad and sausage pizza .everything was good but the standouts for me were definitely the pizza and crostini .after we dined in the restaurant section , we hurried over to check out the patisserie side .just the sight of everything on display made me so envious that echo & rig does n't have a pastry shop ! ?believe me , people would rather be ooooing and ahhhhing over macarons , st honore , opera , and other sweet treats , than oxtails , pigs trotters and head cheese ! ?the pastry shop has a great variety of sexy looking desserts and baked goods as well , but the main attraction here seems to be their macarons that they have two seperate stations ( front entrance and back wall ) that you 're able to purchase at , and even ladies waiting to take your order via i-pad when it gets all cray-cray inside .the violet macaron that i did try was okay , but not the best of our other macaron stops .i hope that echo & rig can somehow squeeze a pastry shop into their location in the future ( fingers crossed ! )that would just be fantabulous !bottega louie is a must if you 're in the city of angels , and oh.sorry bi-rite ( sf ) you 're not the most yelped business.bottega louie is .review # 7391.aloha !shaka meter : \uuu/ \uuu/ \uuu/ \uuu/ \u 4.25 yelp 365 challenge 2014- ( 49/365 ) `` echo & rig 's cousin ''",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,Los Angeles,zgcqpIA-dhBZN8vVuYtacg,BL5_uyrTRqfC8JQhRC7IiA
4,sugarfish-by-sushi-nozawa-beverly-hills,"i have been eyeing sugarfish for a while now , but finally had the opportunity to try it earlier today for lunch .i came in with a friend at around 1pm and the restaurant was relatively empty .we were seated at the awkward corner booth even though there were plenty of regular booths available ( strange , but oh well ) .i went with the `` trust me '' and he ordered the `` trust me lite . ''we were started off with the organic edamame , which was good but nothing special .then , there was the tuna sashimi , which was by far , the best tuna i 've ever had .believe me , i 'm not even a tuna person , but i love how the ponzo house sauce and vinegar perfectly complemented the tuna .perfection .a+ for this dish .as for the albacore that was served next ( 2 pc ) , i personally was n't a big fan of how much sauce was mixed into the rice , but the fish was super fresh so that made up for it .i am a huge salmon fan ( 2pc ) so that was top-notch .i would , however , suggest trying the soy sauce before dipping the sushi because i was n't a huge fan of the sauce either .yellowtail and halibut ( 1pc/each ) were also super impressive in terms of the quality of the fish .again , not a huge fan of the rice , but that 's just my personal preference .what ultimately saved sugarfish from getting 3 stars from me were the two rolls at the end of the meal .the toro hand roll was perfect .the ratio between toro and rice was great .the toro was so , so , so fresh and perfectly fatty , creamy and simply , amazing .i made the mistake of dipping the toro hand roll in the sauce ( oops ) but next time i wo n't !if i thought the toro hand roll was perfect , the blue crab hand roll had me speechless .it was unreal .the crab tasted seafood-y and extremely fresh ( sorry i literally have no better words for it ) and it was just beyond perfect .my mouth is watering as i type .in short , the two hand rolls at the end really saved my sushi experience here .my bill ended up to be around $ 32 with tax and 16 % gratuity ( which was already included in the check - am i the only one who finds this weird ? ) .to me , it was n't that pricey for the quality of the fish .however , my friend was extremely unsatisfied with his meal .maybe he just was n't a big fan of sushi .the ambience was nice , but the service was mediocre .i often found our already tiny table overflowing with empty plates .also , our waitress forgot who ordered the trust me vs. the trust me lite so i was served the lite until i pointed it out .anyway - my craving for the hand rolls and tuna sashimi will eventually lead me back here .i probably would n't go with the trust me menus next time , but it 's a good place to start if you 're a first timer !this place is a bit overhyped but count on me for visiting again !",SWKtu9oJBMpJb3NdcheZ8w,Los Angeles,7DvyZa3ofg1x2z6sCC_org,5ffDdV8up-2EywRYGkrLAw

1,aliotos-restaurant-san-francisco,"i would n't come back here ever again !we got seated and the busser immediately brought us water .he seemed to be the only person who was actually working there .we waited about 10 minutes to get greeted by a woman who was wearing no uniform and looked like a customer .we showed her the yelp coupon for a free calamari and she responded `` i do n't know if it 's available on weekends '' she then proceeded to ask a bunch of people in front of us and then said `` it 's fine i 'll do it '' .we ordered with her as well but she did n't write down anything .one of my friends got the seafood pasta and then me and my other friend both ordered the chicken penne with alfredo .the salads came out and their vinaigrette was really just oil .the salad is just lettuce and a few carrot shavings .i would definitely go for the clam chowder next time .every single table had bread except for us .when we asked for bread the waitress rudely said `` sure '' and dropped it off .all the employees were dressed in casual clothes and it was hard to tell who worked there .there were two men yelling at people on the street to come in and making racial slurs .our server was getting massaged by another man then went upstairs with him and disappeared for the rest of the meal .the calamari we ordered was disgusting .for a seafood place i would expect much more .their cocktail sauce was 99 % ketchup - barely any horseradish .the food finally came out and despite that we said we wanted the same thing the server ( who did n't write anything down and disappeared ) messed it up and we got three different dishes .when i tried to explain to the food runner that we did n't order that he spent 5 minutes trying to convince me to eat it anyway .he finally walked away .10 minutes later another woman came up to us and asked if we worked everything out despite that i clearly did n't have a plate .she did n't apologize or anything - just told me to wait .finally , the food runner came out with a new plate and apologized .when we were done we waited another 20 minutes to get acknowledged so we could get our check .we almost contemplated leaving .the woman finally came with the check and the calamari was on it .i explained to her it was a coupon but since it was once again a different server she did n't believe me and i had to pull it back up .meanwhile the other employees were standing around on their phones screaming at people who walked by .food was ok , but i 've never experienced such bad service and i will definitely not be back !i was a server so i try to give people the benefit of the doubt but i have never had such an experience as this .after everything our 3 pastas came to $ 70 .definitely not worth it .save yourself some time and go get a bowl of clam chowder somewhere else on the wharf .",amx_4CXnyRkQ65ZkFfSqCg,San Francisco,rNzf4XCIJHhA7N95G2h2aQ,2l4hhwUn-2NjSJIGyJFzVA
4,the-derby-arcadia,"the derby is one of those restaurants where time 's stayed still .located in arcadia right on historical route 66 , this steakhouse invites you back to a time where things moved slower and everything was hand made .deco - 4 stars driving up you 'll instantly realize it is valet only and although you 'll panic at first like all frugal people , you 'll notice the sign stating the valet is complimentary .you 'll then frantically check to see if you have cash for later .as you walk towards the restaurant you 'll see the old neon sign and the large statue of a jockey right in front of the entrance .when you walk in you are welcomed into a large restaurant best described as a throwback to the old steakhouses .everything is dark stained wood , red leather , and brick .at the entrance you see a hallway lined with glass cabinets displaying the memorablia of times past for the restaurant , including the noteable history with horse racing and the very restaurant standing because of it ( i heard the owner of the restaurant was the owner of seabiscuit ) .once you walk in you can see yourself enjoying a nice aged brandy with a sports coat and a pipe before you realize you do n't do any of those things .the signature text of the derby on the red covered menu reinforces you are in an aged establishment and just to top it off , you can hear ol ' blue eyes crooning through the speakers .service - 5 stars the service was fantastic .we had an older gentleman named vern greet us .he had that slow drawl and cheerful formality no one under 50 has anymore .he was very kind in the way he took our order as well as being a gentleman showman when presenting us with things like water and the house garlic cheese bread .when our food arrived it was n't brought out just on white plates but covered with cloches , those silver plate covers you see in old movies when being extravagant with food presentations .it was a small detail but a charming one that helped exude the character of this steakhouse .food - 4 stars first all , i dined here using the dinela restaurant week lunch menu .unlike some restaurants , the derby 's lunch extends all the way to 4 pm before switching to their dinner menu .having a partner in crime we ordered 2 different items on each category of appetizer , entree , and dessert .before i go on though let me tell you about the house garlic cheese bread .it is brought out individually made for each person , meaning one at a time .but when it does come out it is warm , cheesy , and filled with a garlic punch .it is the equivalent of a garlic butter toast hugging your insides with love .it takes some time to come out when you want more but it is worth every bite .appetizers bacon wrapped dates - these were good .the dates were n't hard at all and with the salty , savory flavor of the bacon the sweetness was n't over the moon .only two came with this one .bruschetta - one slice of baguette loaded with tomatoes , basil , mozzarella cheese , and shaved parmesan .this was good but both appetizers were definitely more a small bite teaser than anything else .the one gripe i have for both were presentation .they could 've used smaller plates .the medium size plates they used made the portions look weird .entrees - if we 're talking portions though , both entrees made up for any lack of size with the appetizers .filet mignon cobb salad - we ordered the steak to be medium rare but it came out more medium than anything else ; however , the salad was huge and looked very good .with bleu cheese crumbles , heaps of bacon and tomatoes this salad was big enough to take half of it home .prime rib dip - if the tender pieces of prime rib in this sandwich are any indication of how their actual prime rib is they got me sold .the meat was savory and mixed so well with the crisp exterior , yet moist inside of the bread .the au jus was fantastic and even the baked potato was cooked to perfection .i kept eating even after i was full because it tasted so good .dessert - smaller sizes but still wonderful ends to a meal .in truth , the desserts are the main reason i wanted to try this place .`` world famous '' bread pudding - wonderful , moist , sweet , and mouth watering .drizzled with their warm whisky sauce and this dessert made me want more and more .so good i seriously thought of buying just another dessert a la carte .tuxedo mousse cake - with a cake covered in milk chocolate , white chocolate , and dark chocolate mousse it 's hard to go wrong with this .not too chocolately but just enough balance where you want to get back to another bite as soon as you can .price - 4 stars the lunch menu for dinela restaurant week is $ 29 whilst the dinner menu is $ 49 .although i ca n't vouch for the dinner because i never tried it if the dinner is anywhere close to what you get with lunch this place is a real deal .conclusion the derby is a great steakhouse filled with personality and class .a place for an intimate date or a night with the boys .it is a steakhouse worth trying .",ofMESFOXORl9Ng5KGGf4kg,Los Angeles,Gaza-w1XgfxYJKg6sYI6Vg,jHhFCZwplIYevEw9WtjN0Q

1,hop-kee-new-york,"according to my mom , this place has amazing cantonese style ( black bean ) crab and rice noodles ( mi fen ) .she and my aunt loved this place , and said there was always a line for dinner .caveat : this was 40 years ago .flash forward to 2011 , and my mom and i made the trek down to chinatown from the uws for dinner .it was a little later in the night on a weeknight , but the place was completely empty , save for one other table .we ordered the crab , rice noodles with duck , yang chow ( combo ) fried rice and wonton soup ( our eyes were bigger than our stomachs ) .i found it odd that there was american style ( cayenne ) hot sauce on the tables , yet they did n't have white pepper ( hu jiao ) to give us for the soup .anyway , wonton soup came out first .not bad .the soup is a clear broth , light in flavor and the pork wontons had water chestnuts inside which gave them a nice crunchy texture .you really ca n't go wrong with this dish though , i mean , my mom can make this in her sleep .duck rice noodles and yang chow fried rice came out next .very typical stuff , really boring .cookie cutter , if you will .big portions though .lastly , we got the crab .wow , this was beyond disappointing .the majority of the dish was burnt , and not in a `` mmm charred flavor '' way , more like a `` yuck , this is carcinogenic and bitter and tastes terrible '' way ( see my pics ) .we were both pretty let down .nothing was worth the price , and no dish was worth ordering again .this experience totally crushed any sense of nostalgia my mom had for hop kee , though she did see a couple waiters who were working there when she used to frequent the restaurant ( granted , they are senior citizens now ) .there are much better places in chinatown .the only plus is that they are open until 1am .this place is tired and run down , as are their servers .the ambiance screams -- no wait , can barely muster up a yelp of `` blase '' .maybe they just gave up and are thinking they can rely on tv stars to help bring in unknowing customers ?",887-WxTKfe6Tcj3o4nNcfQ,New York,b_2k7yvh6yLGqB9R2RSYWA,U8hHLpSoX49JIcxOzRxxlA

3,minca-new-york,"2.5 stars i really do n't know what to say for this because i do n't want to be salty , just like how the ramen was .( aha ) but honestly , this ramen place was an a-ok place , i would 've given it lower star but i 'm giving it a thumbs up for the price and their amount of meat .let 's get moving to the service first service : horrible service .we came when it was n't even busy , on black friday at like 3 pm , like come on can you actually at least bring me some water ?my friend arrived earl before me so she already ordered her ramen , i arrived later and sat down besides her .and guess what , no one came to give me a menu or ask if i was ready to order , no one give me water or anything .i literally sat there for like 10 min .even when i tried to call for people , they just look confused and never came .wow .wow i mean by 10 min in i was already disappointed food : the food was much better than the service .i ordered the original pork because i wanted the most original taste .the broth was really rich which i liked , but quite salty ( like all the other ramen spots i 've tried ) and i could n't finish even half of the broth because it was just salt in my face .the noodles i did n't really like because it was too al-dente ( i thought it was a bit undercooked ) just like other helpers said .that also blew me off as it took me forever to chew and it was n't bouncy , just hard : / but the chashu pork was absolutely amazing , it 's lean mixed with fatty and it 's sooooo tender and absolutely melts in your mouth .so far this is the only ramen place i 've gone to in ny that gives u this much pork ( ippudo is hyped .2 thin ass slices of meat , no thank you ) i would definitely recommend you to get extra pork/chashu if you can , it is very very good meat overall , this would 've gotten a 4star if not for the service .would n't return .and : also , not being racist , but it really blew me off that not a single worker here was japanese .really ?they were all indians , mexicans , and one chinese .it just feels so fake without japanese , ramen is a really traditional japanese thing .and yet all i could see was these ppl talking in english and it just ruined the whole thing .",W9Zan5NTuyXPBfJ09UX5Nw,New York,6WaXOtyjxWqkkdkuJZqvgA,HWey-_HNXWCo4YNZ7hRdxw

3,luisa-and-sons-bake-shop-norwalk,"i was first attracted to luisa & sons when they were in eagle rock many years ago .their chicken empanada pastry was full of that fresh butter fragrance & moist , soft w/ a touch of sweetness .the filling was shredded white breast meat which was moist , lightly meaty , with perhaps a bit of umami filled gravy & plump raisins .since the lady owner passed away , the empanadas have lost their moist , sweet , buttery , dairy fragrance .1 ) however , i still find that their paksiu na lechon in the freezer section to be exemplary .generous cuts of lechon/roast suckling pig are multilayered w/ a golden brown skin , layer of rich , luscious fat , then a chunk of porky , slightly gamey meat which is pleasantly chewy .the mang tomas sauce is a thickened agrodolce/sweet-sour sauce that has vinegar , sugar , patis/fish sauce , generous amount of whole black pepper corns , & maybe bay leaf which give a smoky , hot , sharp green herbal spiciness , and the pork liver gives the sauce just the right amount of that distinctive liver tasting funk .2 ) their ube egg pie is actually a heavy , creamy , dense custard pie that has that i-can't-explain-it , subtle richness from the infusion of the purple-indigo ube yam .3 ) bicol express has slices of lean pork , red & green bell pepper , onions , garlic , ginger , coconut milk which makes it very heavily creamy .bago'ong/fermented shrimp paste provides the major flavour element so you 'd better like a funky sea fragrance that permeates the entire dish .4 ) pancit malabon seems to have an analog in pasta carbonara which is pasta , eggs , cheese , and bacon .it is rice vermicelli , ground pork , shrimp , chicharon/pork skin , bacon , patis/fish sauce , hard boiled egg , green onions , cabbage , surimi/imitation crab .the rice vermicelli is coated w/ eggs , chicharon , bacon , ground pork to create a rich , fatty pasta dish .lemon slices are added as garnish to squeeze acidic juice to act as a gastrique to counter all that richness .this may be phillipine 's answer to the well known italian dish .5 ) hopia baboy is a semi flakey pastry filled w/ a bean puree .it may be flavoured w/ spiced pork fat thereby the name baboy/pig .inspiration for this bean paste filled pastry seems to come from two directions : china primarily & japan secondarily since some of the hopia have the appellation hapon = japan .it 's primarily comfort food full of carbs & bit of fat .i must say that what will call me back to luisa & sons will always be the paksiu na lechon in all its glory .call ahead since they seem to run out often so save yourself time & fuel .3+ yelp stars for some good pilipino food on the run .",o0exBsBaHnS4O9SHjwwpOQ,Los Angeles,NmrekGP3_-Z9K6cD9zpv7A,UjZPAmLORgN0tuBTHw_Fzw
